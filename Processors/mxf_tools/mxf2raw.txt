Output MXF file metadata and raw essence

Usage: mxf2raw.exe <<Options>> [<<Input Options>> <filename>]+
   Use <filename> '-' for standard input
Options:
 -h | --help           Show usage and exit
 -v | --version        Print version info to stderr
 -l <file>             Log filename. Default log to stderr

 --file-chksum-only <type>
                       Calculate checksum of the file(s) and exit
                       <type> is one of the following: 'crc32', 'md5', 'sha1'

 --group               Use the group reader instead of the sequence reader
                       Use this option if the files have different material packages
                       but actually belong to the same virtual package / group
 --no-reorder          Don't attempt to re-order the inputs, based on timecode, when constructing a sequence
                       Use this option for files with broken timecode

 -i | --info           Extract input information. Default output is to stdout
 --info-format <fmt>   Input info format. 'text' or 'xml'. Default 'text'
 --info-file <name>    Input info output file <name>

 --as10                Extract AS-10 metadata
 --app                 Extract APP metadata
 --app-events <mask>   Extract APP events metadata
                       <mask> is a sequence of event types (e.g. dtv) identified using the following characters:
                           d=digibeta dropout, p=PSE failure, t=timecode break, v=VTR error
 --no-app-events-tc    Don't extract timecodes from the essence container to associate with the APP events metadata
 --app-crc32 <fname>   Extract APP CRC-32 frame data to <fname>
 --app-tc <fname>      Extract APP timecodes to <fname>
 --all-tc <fname>      Extract header and content package metadata timecodes to <fname>
                       The list of timecodes extracted for each frame is as follows:
                         frame position, material package, file source package, physical source package,
                         5 x Avid auxiliary, system item user, system item creation,
                         4 x system scheme 1 timecode array
                       The header metadata timecodes are limited to the set extracted by bmx and what bmx accepts
                       If the timecode property is not present then __:__:__:__ is printed
 --index               Extract index tables
 --avid                Extract Avid metadata
 --st436-mf <count>    Set the <count> of frames to examine for ST 436 ANC/VBI manifest info. Default is 2
 --rdd6 <frames> <filename>
                       Extract RDD 6 audio metadata from <frames> to XML <filename>, e.g. '--rdd6 0-500 output.xml'
                       The output XML will contain the RDD 6 metadata from the first frame and the accumulated program description text
                       from the first and subsequent frames. It is assumed that the RDD 6 metadata is static, except for the frame count and description text.
                       The description text is spread over frames, 1 character per frame for each program.
                       <frames> specifies which frames to extract from and can either be a single frame or a range using '-' as a separator.
                       <frames> is the maximum range of frames to extract a complete description text for all programs.
                       The description text is complete for a program if a start and finally an end marker character have been found.
                       The <frames> range should account for the maximum expected text size and whether programs start their text together or not.
                       Extraction stops once a complete text has been extracted for all programs.
                       If the program description text is not required then set <frames> to 0 to extract RDD 6 from frame 0 only.
 --mca-detail          Show detailed MCA channel label information

                       Extract essence to files starting with <prefix> and suffix '.raw'
 --wrap-klv <mask>     Wrap essence frames in KLV using the input Key and an 8-byte Length
                       The filename suffix is '.klv' rather than '.raw'
                       <mask> is a sequence of characters which identify which data types to wrap
                           v=video, a=audio, d=data
 --read-ess            Read the essence data, even when no other option requires it

 --noro                Don't include roll-out frames
 --rt <factor>         Read at realtime rate x <factor>, where <factor> is a floating point value
                       <factor> value 1.0 results in realtime rate, value < 1.0 slower and > 1.0 faster
 --no-seq-scan         Do not set the sequential scan hint for optimizing file caching
 --mmap-file           Use memory-mapped file I/O for the MXF files
                       Note: this may reduce file I/O performance and was found to be slower over network drives
 --gf                  Support growing files. Retry reading a frame when it fails
 --gf-retries <max>    Set the maximum times to retry reading a frame. The default is 10.
 --gf-delay <sec>      Set the delay (in seconds) between a failure to read and a retry. The default is 1.000000.
 --gf-rate <factor>    Limit the read rate to realtime rate x <factor> after a read failure. The default is 1.500000
                       <factor> value 1.0 results in realtime rate, value < 1.0 slower and > 1.0 faster
 --disable-indexing-file   Use this option to stop the reader creating an index of the partitions and essence positions in the file up front
                           This option can be used to avoid indexing files containing many partitions

 --text-out <prefix>   Extract text based objects to files starting with <prefix>
                       and suffix '.xml' if it is XML and otherwise '.txt'

                              The file suffix is '_<chunk id>_<generic stream id>'

 --chna-text-out <prefix>     Extract mapped ADM CHNA descriptors as a text files starting with <prefix>
                              and suffix '_<MXF track index>.txt'

Input options:
 --disable-tracks <tracks> A comma separated list of track indexes and/or ranges to disable when reading essence data.
                           A track is identified by the index reported by mxf2raw
                           A range of track indexes is specified as '<first>-<last>', e.g. 0-3
 --disable-audio       Disable audio tracks when reading essence data
 --disable-video       Disable video tracks when reading essence data
 --disable-data        Disable data tracks when reading essence data
