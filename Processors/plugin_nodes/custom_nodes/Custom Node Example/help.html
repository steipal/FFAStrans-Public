<b>Example Plugin Processor for developers</b><br/>
This Processor is designed to show off the integration between FFAStrans and a plugin processor node. All available features how a plugin processor can interact with 
FFAStrans is available for testing here. Checkout the documentation on detailed informations about developing custom processors<br/>
<br/><b>Testinput</b>
<br/>How to pass values from FFAStrans to the plugin processor  
<br/>Note that the corresponding open_vars input does not limit the shown variables to "user_vars" only
<br/><br/><b>Test FolderBrowser</b>
<br/>How to open a FolderBrowser from Javascript allowing to choose folders from the local machine (and UNC shares of course)
<br/><br/><b>Test FileBrowser</b>
<br/>How to open a FileBrowser, similar to FolderBrowser
<br/><br/><b>Testoutput</b>
<br/>How to pass an existing user_variable to the Processor in order to allow the processor to set some value in the chosen variables
<br/>It is the responsibility of the processor script/binary to populate some values to the chosen variables
<br/>Note: it makes only sense to select a valid, single variable here. The javascript Code of the GUI index.html must ensure this.
<br/>The demo script processor.ps1 will set a predefined value to the chosen variable: "This testoutput value was calculated and set by processor"
<br/><br/><b>Testoutput2</b>
<br/>Same as Testoutput

<br/><br/><b>Set s_source</b>
<br/>Special functionality: If the processor script does set some value to the inbuilt variable "s_source", the rest of the workflow can work with it.
<br/>Note that s_source is typically used by all processors in order to automatically determine which source file to work with.
<br/>So if your processor generates a new File which the rest of the workflow shall work with, it must set s_source

<br/><br/><b>Set Success Msg</b>
<br/>Special functionality: If the processor script does set a value to the inbuilt variable "s_success", the job Monitor will display this as Message. 

<br/><br/><b>Set Error Msg</b>
<br/>Special functionality: If the processor sets the inbuilt variable s_job_error_msg, the current Branch of the worfklow will end in error or go on execing the connected nodes that are set to be executed on error.

<br/><br/><b>Set End Branch</b>
<br/>Special functionality: If the processor sets the inbuilt variable s_end_branch, the current Branch will end with success immediately
