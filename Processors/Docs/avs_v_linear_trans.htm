<p><b><u>Interpolation</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>Selects the interpolation method that is gonna be used:
<br>
- Trilinear
<br>
- Tetrahedral
<br>
<br>
Trilinear interpolation is used by default only for historical reasons as when this was developed it only had one interpolation method, namely trilinear.
<br>
Although this was far from ideal as it can produce ripples, plenty of people used it (as they were using this function),
<br>
therefore when tetrahedral was introduced it was agreed to leave trilinear as default to allow people to still obtain the same results when upgrading.
<br>
However, in practice, tetrahedral should always be used and it's the suggested method.
<br>

<p><b><u>Info about this filter</u></b></p>
A Linear Transformation is essentially a matrix that maps all points of a certain space to another,
<br>
which includes of course points belonging to a certain curve to other in order to get a different curve.
<br>
Of course, a linear transformation can be used in encoding to map some values to some other values
<br>
and therefore have conversions from curves like PQ to HLG and so on.
<br>
The transformation is performed with 16bit precision, which means that if your input source is lower,
<br>
let's say, 8bit planar yv12, it will be brought to 16bit planar RGB internally,
<br>
the linear transformation will be applied with 16bit planar precision
<br>
and then the result will be brought down to 8bit planar yv12.
<br>
Planar RGB 16bit is strongly suggested as your source as it's gonna be faster,
<br>
in fact 4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:4:4 planar up to 16bit will be converted back and forth internally.
