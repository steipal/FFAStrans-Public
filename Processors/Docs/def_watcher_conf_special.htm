<p>This is the special settings for the workflow.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>Log level</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>Sets the log level of the workflow. Higher log levels produce more detailed logging information for debugging. Logging is always on.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>Protect workflow</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>Here you can protect you workflow with a password. Note that this is not a foolproof protection. It's purpose is to make sure your workflow has a basic protection so it's not easily tampered with.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>Force 32bit dependencies</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>Force FFAStrans to use only 32 bit versions of all dependencies like FFMpeg and AviSynth. This option will override all other 64 bit settings in any workflow nodes.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>Create start TC from Exif data&quot;Date and time (original)&quot; when possible</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED. PLEASE USE THE %s_start_tc_alt% AS INSTEAD.</p>

<p><b><u>Start/Repeated/Stop command</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>These are customizable commands/scripts, with or without arguments, that will start only when the workflow is in <i><u>running state</i></u>. Workflows must therefor be started in order for them to take effekt.</p>
<p style='margin-left:36pt;margin-top:-15pt'>&quot;Start&quot; will (if it's still running) automatically be stopped/aborted on workflow stop.</p>
<p style='margin-left:36pt;margin-top:-15pt'>&quot;Repeated&quot; will only start every sleep cycle if it's not already running and will never be stopped by FFAStrans.</p>
<p style='margin-left:36pt;margin-top:-15pt'>&quot;Stop&quot; is totally unmanaged (fire and forget).</p>
