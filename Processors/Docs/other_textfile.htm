<p>With this node you can create a text file or append to an existing.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>Folder</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>The folder where you want to create the ext file.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>Text file name</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>The file name of the text file.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>Encoding</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>Sets encoding type for the text file. Default is UTF-8 without BOM.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>Append to text file</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>Append the text to an existing file instead of creating a new. If the file does not exits it will be created. This option is handy for creating a document with a list of files that has run through a workflow.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>Set text file as source</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>This option sets the text file as source for all subsequent nodes. It will thereby enable delivery of the text file using &quot;Folder&quot; and &quot;FTP&quot; nodes. <i>Note that the original name will still come from the file picked up by monitors.</i></p>
<p><b><i>Note: This processor also supports writing binary files. If the content of the text field is of a valid binary type (0x&lt;hex&gt;) then the string will be decoded and written as a binary file. In this case &quot;Append to text file&quot; is discarded.</i></b></p>
