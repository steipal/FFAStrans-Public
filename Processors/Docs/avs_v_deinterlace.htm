<p>With this filter you can make interlaced video progressive. To get the best result you should experiment with the different deinterlacers. Some of the interlacers produce double framerate at full height. These are marked with &quot;2xFPS&quot;.</p>

<p><b><u>Method</u></b></p>
<p style=margin-top:-15>Sets the method used for deinterlacing. The fastest being straight BOB deinterlacing which produce double framerate. The slowest being QTGMC but yield far the best results. If you're converting from NTSC that has been telecined (3:2 pulldown, aka 29.970i with 3 fields and 2 repeated frames) you should select "Inverse telecine" in order to revert to the original frame rate of 23.976p.</p>
