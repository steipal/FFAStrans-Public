    <h2><a name="MVTools"></a>I) About MVTools</h2>
    <p>
        MVTools plugin for Avisynth+ and AviSynth 2.6 is collection of functions for estimation
        and compensation of objects motion in video clips.
        Motion compensation may be used for strong temporal denoising, advanced
        framerate conversions, image restoration and other tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The plugin contains the motion estimation server-function MAnalyse to find
        the motion vectors and several motion compensation client-functions
        (MCompensate, MMask and others) which use these vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plugin uses block-matching method of motion estimation (similar methods are
        used in MPEG2, MPEG4, etc).
        At analysis stage plugin divides frames by small blocks and try to find for
        every block in current frame the most similar (matching) block in second frame
        (previous or next).
        The relative shift of these blocks is motion vector.
        The main measure of block similarity is sum of absolute differences (SAD) of
        all pixels of these two blocks compared.
        SAD is a value which says how good the motion estimation was.
    </p>
    <p>
        The output of MAnalyse (server) is special clip with motion vector
        information in some format.
    </p>
    <p>
        At compensation stage the plugin client functions read the motion vectors
        and use them to move blocks and form motion compensated frame (or realize some
        other full or partial motion compensation or interpolation function).
        Every object (block) in this (fully) compensated frame is placed in the same
        position as this object in current frame.
        So, we may (for example) use strong temporal denoising even for quite fast
        moving objects without producing annoying artefactes and ghosting (object's
        features and edges are coincide if compensation is perfect).
        Plugin can create compensated neighbor frames for every current frame, and
        denoise it by internal function.
        Alternatively, you can use compensated and original frames to create
        interleaved clip, denoise it by any external temporal filter, and select
        central cleaned original frames for output (see examples).
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, the motion estimation and compensation is not ideal and precise.
        In some complex cases (video with fading, ultra-fast motion, or periodic
        structures) the motion estimation may be completely wrong, and compensated
        frame will be blocky and (or) ugly.
        Severe difficulty is also due to objects mutual screening (occlusion) or
        reverse opening.
        Complex Avisynth scripts with many motion compensation functions may eat huge
        amount of memory and result in very slow processing.
        It is not simple but quite advanced plugin.
        Use it for appropriate cases only, and try tune its parameters.
        There are many discussions about motion compensation using at doom9 Avisynth
        forum.
        In particular see <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=76041">

    </p>
    <p>
        2.5.11.22 and 2.6.0.5 classic versions had some limitations, only progressive YV12, YUY2 video were supported.
        Versions from 2.7.5.22 support all 420, 422, 444 planar YUV formats, 8 and 10-16 bits
        with recent Avisynth Plus versions.
        Since 2.7.40 almost all 8-32 bit Y, YUV and planar RGB colorspaces are supported for many filters.
        Except that for motion vector search only 8-16 bit Y or YUV clips are supported.

        Use color format conversion and try using (smart) bob-deinterlace for
        interlaced video (<code>SeparateFields</code> may works too with or without
        <code>SelectEven</code>/<code>SelectOdd</code>).
        Some complex scripts (<code>QTGMC</code>, <code>TempGaussMC</code>,
        <code>MVBOB</code>, <code>MCBOB</code>) use MVTools for

    <h2><a name="version2"></a>II) About MVTools version 2</h2>
    <p>
        MVTools version 2 is a major internal and external upgrade.
        Main goals of MVTools v2.X branch are clarity and stability
        (in particular for multithreaded environment with multicore CPU) and of course
        performance and memory usage improving.
    </p>
    <p>
        Main mean for goals achievement is removing MVTools internal buffer
        with mysterious (for many people) index (idx) and some other internal tricks
        (see thread <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=131033">
            MVTools
            without idx
        </a>).
        To implement this without performance degradance we use normal effective
        Avisynth cache and introduce new mandatory preparation stage (before motion
        estimation by <code>MAnalyse</code>).
        At this stage a new function <code>MSuper</code> will get source clip and
        prepare special "super" clip with multilevel (hierarchical scaled) frames data
        (in previous MVTools versions 0.X-1.X these multilevel datas were prepared,
        saved and cached internally with idx as an index of pseudo-clip of these
        "superframes").
        The super clip is then used by both <code>MAnalyse</code> function and client
        motion compensation functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Related syntax change: some <code>MAnalyse</code> parameters (pel, sharp)
        are moved to <code>MSuper</code> function.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other essential external change is replacing all named clips parameters by
        unnamed (mandatory, without double-quotes in description) for normal work of
        Avisynth implicit "last" clip.
    </p>
    <p>Also faster planar processing for YUY2 is implemented in v2.0.</p>
    <p>
        Since v2.2 <code>MVTools.dll</code> is renamed to
        <code>mvtools2.dll</code>, and since v2.3 all functions are renamed from
        MVxxx to Mxxx (e.g. from <code>MVAnalyse</code> to <code>MAnalyse</code>),
        so you can continue to use old MVTools 1.x with your old scripts, and you
        are able to use / make new scripts with MvTools 2.x without changing the
        dll loading.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also have an intention to remove (not implement) some obsolete functions
        like MVDenoise, MVFlowFps2 (please, vote).
    </p>
    <p>Full list of changes see at <a href="#revisions">Revisions</a> section.</p>
    <p>
        Generally, new MVTools 2.0 should provide similar results as v1.11.4.
        Algorithm improvements is planned in v2.1 and later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: MVTools v1.x branch is not developed and not supported anymore
        (by Fizick).
    </p>
    <p>
        To benefit from native multi-threading, you'll have to install the
        latest <code>avstp.dll</code> in your plugin folder.
        This is recommended but not mandatory.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="functions"></a>III) Function descriptions</h2>
    <h3>Common parameters</h3>
    <p>
        Filters that use motion vectors have common parameters.
        Those are the scene-change detection thresholds, and the <var>isse</var> MMX
        flag.
        They also use one or several vectors stream, which are produced by
        <code>MAnalyse</code>.
    </p>
    <p class="var">thSCD1 (int, 400)</p>
    <p>
        Threshold which decides whether a block has
        changed between the previous frame and the current one.
        When a block has changed, it means that motion estimation for it isn't
        relevant.
        It occurs for example at scene changes.
        So it is one of the thresholds used to tweak the scene changes detection
        engine.
        Raising it will lower the number of blocks detected as changed.
        It may be useful for noisy or flickered video.
        The threshold is compared to the SAD (Sum of Absolute Differences, a value
        which says how bad the motion estimation was ) value.
        For exactly identical blocks we have SAD&nbsp;= 0. But real blocks are always
        different because of objects complex movement (zoom, rotation, deformation),
        discrete pixels sampling, and noise.
        Suppose we have two compared 8&times;8 blocks with every pixel different by 5.
        It this case SAD will be 8&times;8&times;5&nbsp;= 320 (block will not detected
        as changed for <var>thSCD1&nbsp;= 400</var>).
        Actually this parameter is scaled internally in MVTools,
        and it is always relative to 8x8 block size.
        Default is 400 (since v.1.4.1).
    </p>
    <p class="var">thSCD2 (int, 130)</p>
    <p>
        Threshold which sets how many blocks have to change
        for the frame to be considered as a scene change.
        It is ranged from 0 to 255, 0 meaning 0&nbsp;%, 255 meaning 100&nbsp;%.
        Default is 130 (which means 51&nbsp;%).
    </p>
    <p class="var">isse (bool, true)</p>
    <p>
        Flag which allows to enable (if set to True) or
        disable ISSE, MMX and other CPU optimizations (for debugging).
        If your processor doesn't support CPU optimizations, it will be disabled
        anyway (and you won't be able to activate them).
    </p>
    <p class="var">planar (bool, false)</p>
    <p>
        Flag to use special planar color format for YUY2
        clips both for input and output of function.
        It uses special trick for storing of frames with planar color data
        organisation (separate Y, U, V planes in memory) in normal interleaved YUY2
        frames format as a container.
        This way we can avoid numerous internal interleaved to planar conversions and
        increase speed.
        You can convert normal interleaved YUY2 source clip to planar format with
        <code>Interleaved2planar</code> function from
        <a href="http://home.pages.at/kassandro/RemoveGrain/">
            RemoveGrain plugin by
            kassandro
        </a>,
        and convert final result by <code>Planar2interleaved</code> function.
        This special planar YUY2 format is also supported by Removegrain plugin by
        Kassandro, MaskTools2 plugin by Manao and some others.
        This trick will not be needed in Avisynth v2.6 with native support of planar
        YV16 format.
        This paramenter is ignored for YV12 clips. Note: super clip is always planar.
    </p>

    <h3>MSuper</h3>
<pre class="proto">MSuper (
	clip,
	int  hpad (8),
	int  vpad (8),
	int  pel (2),
	int  levels (0),
	bool chroma (true),
	int  sharp (2),
	int  rfilter (2),
	clip pelclip (undefined),
	bool isse,
	bool planar,
	bool mt (true)
)</pre>
    <p>
        Get source clip and prepare special "super" clip with multilevel
        (hierarchical scaled) frames data.
        The super clip is used by both <code>MAnalyse</code> and motion compensation
        (client) functions.
        For storing and transferring its parameters we use audio properties of super
        clip (specifically, <code>num_audio_samples</code>) as a trick.
        So, audio is killed in super clip.
        That is one of reasons why we additionally use source clip with client
        functions.
        You may have a look to super clip yourself (it has normal format).
        Supported formats: greyscale, YUV and planar RGB 8-32 bits, YUY2
        You can use different Super clip for generation vectors with MAnalyze and a different
        super clip format for the actual action. Thus MFlowFPS can support native RGB (planar),
        and MDegrain can work with 32 bit float input clips.
    </p>
    <p class="var">hpad</p>
    <p>
        It is horizontal padding added to source frame (both left and right).
        Small padding is added for more correct motion estimation near frame borders.
        (In MVTools before v2.0 the value of padding = block size was always used
        internally. Now it is not strict but recommended value.)
    </p>
    <p class="var">vpad</p>
    <p>It is vertical padding added to source frame (both top and bottom).</p>
    <p class="var">pel</p>
    <p>
        It is the accuracy of the motion estimation.
        Value can only be 1, 2 or 4.
        1 means a precision to the pixel.
        2 means a precision to half a pixel,
        4 means a precision to quarter a pixel, produced by spatial interpolation
        (more accurate but slower and not always better due to big level scale step).
        Default is 2 since v1.4.10.
    </p>
    <p class="var">levels</p>
    <p>
        It is the number of hierarchical levels in super clip frames.
        <code>MAnalyse</code> is need in all levels, but for other client functions
        single finest level is enough (coarser levels are not used).
        0&nbsp;= auto, all possible levels are produced.
    </p>
    <p class="var">chroma</p>
    <p>
        If set to true, it allows to prepare chroma planes too in superclip.
        False means luma only.
    </p>
    <p class="var">sharp</p>
    <p>
        Subpixel interpolation method for <var>pel</var>&nbsp;= 2 or 4.
        Use:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr><td><b>0</b></td><td>for soft interpolation (bilinear),</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>1</b></td><td>for bicubic interpolation (4 tap Catmull-Rom),</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>2</b></td><td>for sharper Wiener interpolation (6 tap, similar to Lanczos).</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        This parameter controls the calculation of the first level only.
        When <var>pel&nbsp;= 4</var>, bilinear interpolation is always used to compute
        the second level.
    </p>
    <p class="var">rfilter</p>
    <p>Hierarchical levels smoothing and reducing (halving) filter.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><td><b>0</b></td><td>Simple 4 pixels averaging like unfiltered SimpleResize (old method),</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>1</b></td><td>Triangle (shifted) filter like <code>ReduceBy2</code> for more smoothing (decrease aliasing),</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>2</b></td><td>Triangle filter like <code>BilinearResize</code> for even more smoothing,</td></tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>3</b></td>
            <td>
                Quadratic filter for even more smoothing,</li>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><b>4</b></td><td>Cubic filter like <code>BicubicResize(b=1, c=0)</code> for even more smoothing.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Default is 2 (since v2.3.1).
        You may also try to apply some external filter to superclip or its coarse
        bottom part (by appropriate crop and overlay).
    </p>
    <p class="var">pelclip</p>
    <p>
        Optional upsampled source clip for using instead of internal subpixel
        interpolation (for <var>pel&nbsp;&gt; 1</var>).
        Pixels at rows and colunms positions multiple to pel (0, 2, 4,… for
        <var>pel&nbsp;= 2</var>) (without padding) must be original source pixels,
        other pixels must be interpolated.
        Example for <var>pel&nbsp;= 2</var>:
    </p><p>
<pre class="src">LanczosResize (width*2, height*2, src_left=0.25, src_top=0.25)</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Recent note: it is true for luma, but it doesn't correspond to chroma
        pixels positions of internal MVTools interpolation.
        Nevertheless vectors and motion compensation are quite similar for usual
        clips, same chroma would be with <code>src_left&nbsp;= 0.5</code> for YUY2 and
        additionally <code>src_top&nbsp;= 0.5</code> for YV12.
    </p>
    <p>Other useful example is EEDI2 edge-directed resampler.</p>
    <p class="var">mt</p>
    <p>Enables internal multi-threading (through avstp.dll).</p>

        Get prepared multilevel super clip, estimate motion by block-matching

        functions).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some hierarchical multi-level search methods are implemented (from coarse
        image scale to finest).
        Function uses zero vector and neighbors blocks vectors as a predictors for
        current block.
        Firstly difference (SAD) are estimated for predictors, then candidate vector
        changed by some values to some direction, SAD is estimated, and so on.
        The accepted new vector is the vector with minimal SAD value (with some
        penalty for motion coherence).

    <p>
        Try using <code>MShow</code> function to check estimated motion field and
        tune parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: <code>MAnalyse</code> (if <var>pel&nbsp;&ge; 2</var>) detects fieldbased
        video flag (after <code>SeparateFields</code>) and automatically makes
        correction of motion vectors according to verticlal shift of fields with
        different parity.
        Try using AssumeFrameBased if you do not need in it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Technical note: MAnalyse does not generate a regular clip that can be
        displayed.
        Don't try to modify its content or it will get corrupted.
        It is made of a single long line, actually containing binary data (vectors,
        block SAD, misc. information…) instead of pixel values.
        It also alters the audio descriptor to pass additional data to other
        filters before any frame request.
        Therefore, in the current state, a vector clip cannot be saved to a lossless
        file and reloaded later for processing.
        If you want to do so, you have to transcode it first with
        <code>MStoreVect</code> and <code>MRestoreVect</code>.
        Furthermore, joining vector clips generated with different parameters may
        lead to unexpected results, because the aforementioned additional data is
        global to the whole clip and is not updated on each frame.
        When the MAnalyse filter is destructed (removed from the memory), the
        additional data is lost too, and an attempt to using the produced vectors
        may crash the application or give wrong results.
        For this reason, avoid using MAnalyse in <code>ScriptClip</code> and other
        functions of the Avisynth runtime subsystem.

    <p class="var">blksizeV</p>
    <p>
        Vertical size of a block.
        Default is equal to horizontal size.
    </p>
    <p class="var">levels</p>
    <p>
        A positive value is the number of levels used in the hierarchical
        analysis made while searching for motion vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Negative or zero value is the number of coarse levels NOT used in the
        hierarchical analysis made while searching for motion vectors.
        The lower the usually better (vectors with any length can be found).
        It is kept variable for study's purposes mostly.
        Sometimes <var>levels</var> is useful to prevent large (false) vectors
        (computer graphics, etc).
        Default = 0 since v.2.5 (all levels are used).
    </p>
    <p class="var">search, searchparam, pelsearch</p>
    <p>
        <var>search</var> decides the type of search at every level,
        <var>searchparam</var> is an additional parameter (step, radius) for this
        search, and <var>pelsearch</var> is the radius parameter at finest (pel)
        level.
        Below are the possible values for the <var>search</var> type:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr><td><b>0</b></td><td>'OneTimeSearch'. <var>searchparam</var> is the step between each vectors tried (if <var>searchparam</var> is superior to 1, step will be progressively refined).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>1</b></td><td>'NStepSearch'. N is set by <var>searchparam</var>. It's the most well known of the MV search algorithm.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>2</b></td><td>Logarithmic search, also named Diamond Search. <var>searchparam</var> is the initial step search, there again, it is refined progressively.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>3</b></td><td>Exhaustive search, <var>searchparam</var> is the radius (square side is 2*radius+1). It is slow, but it gives the best results, SAD-wise.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>4</b></td><td>Hexagon search, <var>searchparam</var> is the range. (similar to x264).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>5</b></td><td>Uneven Multi Hexagon (UMH) search, <var>searchparam</var> is the range. (similar to x264).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>6</b></td><td>pure Horizontal exhaustive search, <var>searchparam</var> is the radius (width is 2*radius+1).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>7</b></td><td>pure Vertical exhaustive search, <var>searchparam</var> is the radius (height is 2*radius+1).</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p class="var">isb</p>
    <p>
        Allows to choose between a forward search (motion from the previous frame
        to current one) for <var>isb&nbsp;=false</var> and a backward search (motion
        from following frame to the current one) for <var>isb&nbsp;=true</var> (isb
        stands for "IS Backward", it is implemented and named exactly as written here,
        do not ask :-).
    </p>
    <p class="var">chroma</p>
    <p>
        Set to true, it allows to take chroma into account when
        doing the motion estimation (false: luma only).
    </p>
    <p class="var">delta</p>
    <p>
        Set the frame interval between the reference frame and the current frame.
        By default, it's 1, which means that the motion vectors are searched between
        the current frame and the previous (or next) frame.
        Setting it to 2 will allow you to search mvs between the frame n and n-2 or
        n+2 (depending on the <var>isb</var> setting).
        If delta is negative or null, -delta is the absolute index of a fixed
        reference frame.
        In this case, the <var>isb</var> value is ignored.
        Only a few functions are compatible with fixed reference frames
        (<code>MCompensate</code>, <code>MFlow</code> and <code>MDegrain*</code>).
    </p>
    <p class="var">pzero</p>
    <p>
        relative penalty (scaled to 256) to SAD cost for zero vector.
        It prevent replacing of quite good predictor by zero vector with a little
        better SAD (<var>lambda</var> is not used for zero vector).
        Default is equal to <var>pnew</var> since v1.11.
    </p>
    <p class="var">pglobal</p>
    <p>
        Relative penalty (scaled to 256) to SAD cost for global predictor vector.
        (<var>lambda</var> is not used for global vector).
    </p>
    <p class="var">overlap</p>
    <p>
        block overlap value (horizontal).
        Must be even and less than block size (up to <var>blksize/2</var> for
        <code>MCompensate</code>).
        The step between blocks for motion estimation is equal to
        (<var>blksize</var> &minus;&nbsp;<var>overlap</var>).
        N blocks cover the size
        ((<var>blksize</var> &minus;&nbsp;<var>overlap</var>) *&nbsp;N +&nbsp;<var>overlap</var>)
        on frame.
        Try using overlap value from <var>blksize/4</var> to b<var>blksize/2</var>.
        The greater overlap, the more blocks number, and the lesser the processing
        speed.
        However the default value 0 may cause blocking-like artefacts.
        Functions with overlap support are:
        <code>MFlow</code>, <code>MFlowInter</code>, <code>MFlowFps</code>,
        <code>MShow</code>, <code>MMask</code>, <code>MCompensate</code> and all the
        <code>MDeGrain*</code>.

        Name of file to write motion vectors data, or an empty string (nothing

        This data may be used by some external program or may be by next MVTools
        versions for second pass coding, etc.
        Produced binary file has a header (<code>MVAnalysisData</code> structure,
        see <code>MVInterface.h</code> source code), and the data sequence:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Frame number,</li>

        Important: using <var>outfile</var> in a multi-threaded context (Classic Avisynth MT modes
        1, 2 and 4, or setting other than MT_SERIALIZED for Avisynth+) has an undefined behaviour and will generate a corrupted file.

        When set to true, MAnalyse generates the motion vectors for all the
        reference frames &minus;delta…&minus;1 and +1…+delta.
        The resulting clip is made of single MAnalyse results interleaved in the delta
        order &minus;1, +1, &minus;2, +2, …, &minus;delta, +delta, where negative
        values indicate backward searchs.
        This order is similar to the motion vector parameters in
        <code>MDegrain3</code>.
        The output clip is intended to be used directly in <code>MDegrainN</code>.
        Single motion vector clips can be extracted with a

        Enables internal multi-threading (through avstp.dll). default is true
        When avstp.dll is not present, parameter is ineffective.
    </p>
    <p>
        Important note!<br />
        Parameter mt=true is giving a bit worse and not 100% similar result as mt=false.
        This is _not_ Avisynth's multithreading, this is the filter's internal one.<br />
        For speedup you can always use Avisynth's mt support (see Prefetch) and
        delete avstp.dll or set mt=false if you still need avstp.dll for other tasks.<br />
        When mt = true and avstp.dll is found then internal multithreading is active.
        Internal mt is processing the X*Y sized motion block matrix in "slices", where
        slices are still matrixes with with a smaller vertical size. The original matrix
        is divided vertically to 2, 3, ... (depends on processor count) units.
        As and example: let's suppose we have two threads. One thread is processing
        blocks with y coordinates from 0 to height/2-1 (=top half), and the other thread from
        height/2 to height-1 (bottom half).
        Unfortunately - for algorithmical reasons - this speedup results in different output as
        the single-thread case due to the fact that the unit boundaries are handled specially.
        A non-multithreaded approach is processing the whole frame in a single run, in one thread, having
        only 2 (namely the top and bottom lines) boundary, while the N-thread version has N*2 boundary.

    <h4>Truemotion parameters</h4>
    <p>
        There are few advanced parameters which set coherence of motion vectors
        for so called true motion estimation.
        Some matched blocks from other frame may be most similar to sample blocks of
        current frame by intensity criterion (SAD), but not correspond to true object
        motion.
        For example, they may belong to other similar object in different corner of
        the frame or belong to some periodic structure.
        "True motion" parameters try maintain the motion field more coherent, instead
        of some random vectors distribution.
        It is especially important for partial motion compensation and interpolation.
        Some parameters are experimental and may be removed (replaced) in next
        versions after testing.
        Please report your conclusions.
    </p>
    <p class="var">truemotion</p>
    <p>
        This is a preset of these parameters values.
        It allows easy to switch default values of all "true motion" parameters at once.
        Set it <var>true</var> for true motion search (high vector coherence),
        set it <var>false</var> to search motion vectors with best SAD.
        Default is true since v1.4.10.
        In any case you can tune each parameter individually.
    </p>
    <p class="var">lambda</p>
    <p>
        Set the coherence of the field of vectors.
        The higher, the more coherent.
        However, if set too high, some best motion vectors can be missed.
        Values around 400&ndash;2000 (for block size 8) are strongly recommended.
        Internally it is coefficient for SAD penalty of vector squared difference
        from predictor (neighbors), scaled by 256.
        Default is 0 for <var>truemotion&nbsp;= false</var> and
        1000*<var>blksize</var>*<var>blksizeV</var>/64

        SAD limit for <var>lambda</var> using. Local <var>lambda</var> is decreased
        (smoothly since v1.10.2) if SAD value of vector predictor (formed from
        neighbor blocks) is greater than the limit.
        It prevents bad predictors using but decreases the motion coherence.
        Values above 1000 are recommended for true motion.
        Scaled to 8x8 blocksize internally (since v2.0.11).
        Default is 400 for <var>truemotion&nbsp;= false</var> and 1200 for
        <var>truemotion&nbsp;= true</var>.
    </p>
    <p class="var">pnew</p>
    <p>
        Relative penalty (scaled to 256) to SAD cost for new candidate vector.
        New candidate vector must be better will be accepted as new vector only if its
        SAD with penalty (SAD + SAD*pnew/256) is lower then predictor cost (old SAD).
        It prevent replacing of quite good predictors by new vector with a little
        better SAD but different length and direction.
        Default is 0 for <var>truemotion&nbsp;= false</var> and 50 for
        <var>truemotion&nbsp;= true</var>.

    <p>
        Note that vector length is smaller at lower level.

    <p>
        Do a motion compensation of the frame not by blocks (like
        <code>MCompensate</code>), but by pixels.
        Motion vector for every pixel is calculated by bilinear interpolation of
        motion vectors of current and neighbor blocks (according to pixel position).
        It means that the pixels pointed by the vector in the reference frame
        will be moved (flow) along the vectors to reach their places in the current
        frame.
        This flow motion compensation method does not produce any blocking artefactes,
        and is good for denoising, but sometimes can create very strange deformed
        pictures.
        True motion estimation is strongly recommended for this function.
        Motion compensation may be full or partial (at intermediate time).
        Important limitation: vectors with components above 127 will be reset to zero

        Motion interpolation function.
        It is not the same (but similar) as <code>MVInterpolate</code> function of
        older MVTools version.
        It uses backward <var>mvbw</var> and forward <var>mvfw</var> motion vectors
        to create picture at some intermediate time moment between current and next
        (by delta) frame.
        It uses pixel-based (by <code>MFlow</code> method) motion compensation from
        both frames.
        Internal forward and backward occlusion masks (<code>MMask</code>
        <var>kind&nbsp;= 2</var> method) and time weighted factors are used to produce
        the output image with minimal artefacts.
        True motion estimation is strongly recommended for this function.

    <p>
        If set, the <var>time</var> parameter is ignored.
        Then the time for the motion interpolation is applied pixel-wise.
        Each component of each pixel of <var>tclip</var> gives the time to be applied
        to the corresponding <var>source</var> clip pixel.
        The time scale is 256, meaning that 0 corresponds to the current frame,
        and 255 is an almost the next frame (128 is exactly half-way).
        A single occlusion mask is calculated with the luma-time only,
        therefore it is recommended to keep the chroma-time synchronized
        with the luma.

        Maximal change of pixel luma. This is a post-processing like the
        <code>DeGrainMedian</code> plugin and <code>LimitChange</code> function
        from the SSETools plugin, to prevent some artifacts).
        Value is 0 to 255. 255 does nothing. Other values are scaled proportionally for the given bit depth.
        From 2.7.42 version the type of parameter is float instead of integer. This allows more granurality
        at 10+ bits.
        Calculation:
        real_limit = limit * (2^(bit_depth - 8)) for 8-16 bits (=limit for 8 bit videos)
        and
        real_limit = limit / 255.0 for 32 bit float formats.

        The picture made of the most siginificant bytes (MSB) is stacked
        on the top of the least significant byte (LSB) block.
        Hence a twice taller resulting picture.
        You can extract the MSB or the LSB with a simple Crop() call.
        This mode helps recovering the full bitdepth of temporally dithered data.

        The two-stage method may be also useful for more stable (robust) motion
        estimation.
        The refining is at finest hierarchical level only.
        Interpolated vectors of old blocks are used as predictors for new vectors,
        with recalculation of SAD.
        Only bad quality new vectors with SAD above threshold <var>thSAD</var> will be

    <p>
        Rescales motion vectors / blocksize.
        Main purpose is to allows vectors to be used on a differently sized clip or on a clip having different bit depth (2.7.24-) than
        they were analyzed from.
    </p>
    <p>Example steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use <code>MAnalyze</code> on a half-sized clip at block size 16</li>
        <li>Use this plugin to scale the vectors by 2 to block size 32</li>
        <li>
            Use resulting vectors for <code>MFlowFPS</code>, <code>MDegrain</code>,…
            on the full sized frame.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Saves doing the <code>MAnalyze</code> on the full size frame, which may be
        faster and saves memory (good for multi-threading).
        Note that you need a super clip for each frame size.
        The padding (hpad, vpad) on each super clip must be manually scaled to match
        the vector scaling (can be easier to set <var>hpad&nbsp;= 0</var> and
        <var>vpad&nbsp;= 0</var> everywhere).
        See the example below.
        Similar functionality was available in MVTools through the function
        <code>MVIncrease</code>, but it was removed.
    </p>
    <p>The function returns a new motion vector clip.</p>

        The amount to scale the vectors, <var>scale</var> is the horizontal
        scaling, <var>scaleV</var> is the vertical scaling.
        Exact meaning depends on mode.
        Default value is 2.0, except when <var>bits</var> is given (in this case 1.0)

        Default is true if scale is negative and equal to <var>scaleV</var>.
        I.e. if you reverse the vectors it will default to flip their direction.
    </p>
    <p class="var">adjustSubPel</p>
    <p>
        Set to true in <var>mode&nbsp;= 0, 1</var> to perform scaling by adjusting

        Experimental.
    </p>
    <p class="var">bits</p>
    <p>
        Change the bit depth that the motion vector clip is reporting.
        Possible values: 0 (default), 8, 10, 12, 14, 16. Value of 0 does not change bit depth.
        During the conversion SAD values for each block are scaled according to the bit-depth difference. The scaling factor is 2^(bits - source_bit_depth) with rounding when scaling down.
        E.g. analyze your clip in 8 bits (faster), then use vectors for a 16 bit super clip by setting <var>bits</var>=16
    </p>

    <p>
        This parameter can be combined with x and y scaling.
        Warning: when this parameter exists and is nonzero then the default value of <var>scale</var> is 1.0 instead of 2.0.
    </p>

    <h4>Example</h4>
<pre class="src">clip = YourSource( "Your\Video" )

# Half size clip
clipScaled = clip.BicubicResize( clip.Width()/2, clip.Height()/2 )

# Half size padding (may be easier to always set hpad and vpad to 0)

    <h3>MStoreVect</h3>
<pre class="proto">MStoreVect (

    <p>
        Stores (multiple) motion vectors in a encodable clip.
        Allows you to encode vectors to a file (must use a lossless format, suggest
        Lagarith for RGBA).
        Convenient for splitting up very slow scripts (e.g. calculate vectors and save
        in pass 1, load vectors and process in stage 2).
        Can also use to process the same footage in multiple ways.
        Use <code>MRestoreVect</code> to get the motion vectors back out of the
        clip.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can store as many sets of vectors as you wish in a single clip, as long
        as the clips have the same length.
        It's possible to store a multi-vector clip too.
        The clip can be in any of the supported colorspaces;
        its width and height will vary depending on the contained clips, but the
        height will always be divisible by 2.
    </p>
    <p>The function returns a clip that contains the provided motion vectors.</p>
    <p class="var">vectors</p>
    <p>MVTools vectors clip, you may pass as many clips as you wish.</p>
    <p class="var">vccs</p>

        Only "RGB32", "RGB24" and "YUY2" are currently supported.

        second, etc.

    <h4>Example</h4>
<pre class="src">clip = YourSource( "Your\Video" )

    <p>2.7.46 (20240503)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recheck and fix build processes for various compilers<br />
            (Visual Studio MSVC v143, v141_xp; Intel C++ Compiler 2024.1 ICX, 19.2 ICL; ClangCL; gcc mingw64)
        </li>
        <li>Fix (#56): bug in Cross search</li>
        <li>(unreleased 2.7.46 (20230208) test build in https://github.com/pinterf/mvtools/issues/58)</li>
        <li>Fix (#58): MFlowFPS memory leak</li>
        <li>Fix (#49): lsad 0 caused division-by-zero crash</li>
        <li>Optimization: MDegrain1-6 8 bit: Add avx2 code path (already was in code but disabled, now go live)
        <li>Optimization: MDegrainN 10-16 bits: SSE4.1 code path (was: C only)</li>
        <li>Optimization: VerticalBicubic interpolation SSE4.1 version besides SSE2</li>
        <li>Fix: MRestoreVect was trying to create unaligned frame (crash)</li>
        <li>(#48) Project files/solution: Intel C++ Compiler 2021 (icx) and 19.2 (icl classic) support on Windows</li>
        <li>Source internals: MDegrain: for block size of 4, read exactly 4 bytes instead of 8. (in extreme cases it would read past a valid memory area)</li>
        <li>MDegrain1-6 8 bit: Add avx2 code path (already was in code but disabled, now go live)</li>
        <li>Possible LLVM-build speedup by not using _mm256_zeroupper in avx2,<br />
            compilers do that automatically. LLVM builds, because it unoptimizedly saved and restored _all_ ymm registers (slow!)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.45 (20210608)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fix: change parameter 'ml' from int to float in MBlockFPS.<br />
            (Other filters with 'ml' are O.K.: MMask, MFlowInter, MFlowFPS are using float.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Fix MBlockFPS html doc as well, which mentions 'thres' instead of 'ml'<br />
            Add mode 5-8 to MBlockFPS docs
        </li>
        <li>move change log from readme to CHANGELOG.md</li>
        <li>
            Code change/speedup: MSuper: rfilter=0 and 1<br />
            8 bit: drop old SSE code, port to SIMD intrinsics. Add SIMD to 16 bit case. Quicker, much quicker.<br />
            (rfilter: Hierarchical levels smoothing and reducing (halving) filter)
        </li>
        <li>Code change/speedup: MSuper: sharp=1 for pel=2 or 4</li>
        Bicubic resizer drop old SSE code, port to SIMD intrinsics, implement SIMD intrinsics to 16 bit case.
        <br />
        No need for Bilinear.asm and Bilinear-x64.asm any more.</li>
        <li>SATD: add 8 bit C versions (geee, there wasn't one) (as an alternative to the external asm)</li>
        <li>SAD: add internal SIMD for 8 bit SAD (SSE4.1) (as an alternative to the external asm)</li>
        <li>Overlaps: Add internal SIMD for 8 bit. (as an alternative to the external asm)</li>
        <li>
            Source code:<br />
            In def.h any existing external assembler file can be disabled. <br />
            The primary reason for this was to quickly test the linux port, for me this was easier than bothering with asm compilation and linking.<br />
            For non-Windows cases all of these are disabled now.<br />
            - USE_COPYCODE_ASM (CopyCode-a.asm). Has internal alternative. Same speed.<br />
            - USE_OVERLAPS_ASM (Overlap-a.asm). asm implements 8 bit only. Has internal SIMD alternative. About the same speed.<br />
            - USE_SAD_ASM (sad-a.asm) asm implements 8 bit only. Note: Internal 8 bit SIMD SAD is a bit slower that these handcrafted ones.<br />
            - USE_SATD_ASM (Pixel-a.asm) asm implements 8 bit only. Note: SATD 8 bit has no SIMD replacement yet. <br />
            - USE_LUMA_ASM (Variance-a.asm) asm implements 8 bit only. Has internal alternative.<br />
            - USE_FDCT88INT_ASM (fdct_mmx.asm, fdct_mmx_x64.asm) <br />
            Only used for 8x8 block sizes. Quick integer version instead of fftw3.<br />
            No internal alternative, fftw3 is used instead.<br />
            - USE_AVSTP (do find search for avstp.dll on Windows)
        </li>
        <li>Minor and not so minor cosmetics, mainly for GCC.</li>
        <li>Add Cmake build system.</li>
        <li>
            MvTools2: Linux/GCC port (needs sse4.1), Dewindowsification.<br />
            fftw3: MAnalyze dct modes that require fftw3 library will search for libfftw3f_threads.so.3<br />
            Install either libfftw3-single3 (deb) or fftw-devel (rpm) package");<br />
            e.g. sudo apt-get update<br />
            sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
        </li>
        <li>
            Not done (will be done in a second phase):<br />
            Add back some external asms for linux build. For 8 bit SAD and SATD mainly.<br />
            Linux port is still Intel-only, though every part has C alternative by now.
        </li>
        <li>Separate the 3 projects (mvtools2, depan, depan_estimate).</li>
        <li>DePan and DePanEstimate: Linux port</li>
        <li>DePanEstimate: add fft_threads variable (default 1) for fftw3 mode (experimental)</li>
        <li>DepanEstimate: add MT guard around sensible fft3w functions</li>
        <li>mingw build fixes</li>
        <li>Add build instructions to README.md</li>
        <li>experimental avx2 for MDegrain1..6 (was not worth speedwise on my i7700 - memory transfer is bottleneck)</li>
        <li>
            experimental 32-bit float internal Overlaps result buffer for MDegrain1..6<br />
            whether if it is any quicker/more exact than the integer-scaled arithmetic version<br />
            (when out32=true, do not use, it is only for development/test, maybe will be removed in the future)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.44 (20201214)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            MAnalyze: fix motion vector generation inconsistencies across multiple runs.<br />
            Note: when internal multithreading is used (avstp + mt=true), inconsistencies will still occur by design.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.43 (20200602)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MCompensate: fix crash for GreyScale formats when overlap is used</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.42 (20200522)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MDegrain family: limit and limitc parameters to float - allowing more granurality for 10+ bits. Range is still 0-255 but floating point</li>
        <li>Update Avisynth headers, use V8 interface frame property copy if available</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2.7.41/b (20200430)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            (no change in MVTools2, but fixes in Depan.DLL: DepanInterleave and Depan. See their readme)<br />
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>2.7.41 (20190502)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: regression since 2.7.35: MSuper chroma for non-planar YUY2 (Thanks to mkauf)</li>
        <li>Project moved to Visual Studio 2019, v141_xp and v142 toolset</li>
        <li>
            (New: DepanStabilize: planar RGB support (8-16bit) - see also there<br />
            Generate motion vectors with mvtools MDepan, use it for DepanStabilize. Input clip can be planar RGB.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.40 (20190212)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: MFlowInter possible crash with specific parameter and colorspace settings.</li>
        <li>Fix: MFlowInter possible overflow at 16 bit clips (artifacts)</li>
        <li>
            MFlow, MFlowInter, MFlowFPS, MFlowBlur, MBlockFPS: support all 8-16 and 32 bit float Y, YUV (4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:4:4) and planar RGB color spaces.<br />
            Input clip (and super) format now is fully independent from vector clip's base format (subsampling had to be the same before)<br />
            E.g. make motion vector clips from a YV12 source and apply them on a 8-32 bit 4:4:4 input
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.39 (20190102)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MSuper: fix 16 bits, pel=2, sharp=2, which caused bottom section artifacts for MDegrains for 8 bit vector origin and 16 bit real clip</li>
        <li>
            MDegrain1-6,N: Enhanced:<br />
            Input clip (and super) format now is fully independent from vector clip's base format (subsampling had to be the same before)<br />
            E.g. make motion vector clips from a YV12 source and apply them on a 8-32 bit 4:4:4 input
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.38 (20181209)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MCompensate: Fix regression in latest v37: MCompensate w/ overlap=0 crash</li>
        <li>MAnalyze DCT: FFTW float: quicker postprocess of DCT'd blocks, now is correct for non power-of-2 block sizes e.g. 12x12 or 24x24 (no effect on 8x8 for which fast integer DCT is used)</li>
        <li>MAnalyze DCT: more consistent handling of post DCT internal normalization for non-square block sizes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.37 (20181128)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MCompensate: limit thSAD, thSAD2, thSCD1 to valid range 0-(8x8x255) (e.g. given thSAD = 100000 will go back to 16320)</li>
        <li>Fix: MCompensate: use int64 to avoid effective thSAD and thSAD2 overflow typically happen at bigger block sizes or large thSAD parameter value.</li>
        <li>MCompensate: SSE2 (8bit) and SSE4 (10-16 bit) overlap result calculation</li>
        <li>Changed: SAD 8x8, 8x4, 4x4, 4x8 to use SSE2 instead of MMX registers</li>
        <li>Fix: MDegrain if overlap<>0: missing rounder in rightmost 8 pixels for non-mod8 width 8 bit clips</li>
        <li>Fix: MSuper artifacts at 10-32 bits and nPel==4</li>
        <li>
            New: MCompensate 32 bit float and planar RGB support (by using motion vectors made from 8-16 bit YUV clip).
            Input and super clip can be of a different format than the one used for motion vector creation. (Similar to MDegrain1-6)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.36 (20181120)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: Allow overlap operation when there are only two blocks in either horizontal or vertical direction (was: division by 0 crash)</li>
        <li>
            Fix: Fallback to overlap=0 mode when block count is only 1 in either h or v direction (was: undefined behaviour)<br />
            The cases above occured for small frame sizes, when frame size and overlap values resulted in less than 3 blocks in a direction.
        </li>
        <li>Misc: update html docs with overlap drawing and others.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.35 (20181113)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MFlowXXX: Slight speed gain by putting the out-of-frame vector check to resizer</li>
        <li>MAnalyze: Fix a possible internal overflow on larger blocksizes with small overlap e.g. BlkSize=32, OverlapX=0, OverlapY=4.</li>
        <li>MSuper: Planar RGB support</li>
        <li>MFlowFPS: Planar RGB support: generate vectors in YUV, use RGB input and super clip</li>
        <li>MFlowFPS: less memory for 4:4:4 and greyscale</li>
        <li>MFlowFPS: a bit faster 4:4:4, much faster greyscale</li>
        <li>MFlowFPS: support different bit depth for clip and the vectors (use vectors from 8 bit analysis for a 16 bit clip)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.34 (20181108)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MFlowInter: Use less memory, eliminates ten full-frame internal buffers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.33 (20181021)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MFlowXX: Fix random access violation caused by enlarged vectors pointing on out-of-frame positions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.32 (20181018)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MAnalyze: Enhance mt mode report for Avisynth+: MT_SERIALIZED instead of MT_MULTI_INSTANCE when temporal=true or using output file.</li>
        <li>MAnalyze: fix a possible internal overflow on larger blocksizes and lambda combinations. e.g. truemotion=true with blksize=32</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.31 (20180409)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: MFlow: SC detection after having the mv clip. Fixed in 2.5.11.22 but was missed during 2.6.0.5 merge.</li>
        <li>Fix: MFlow: crash in 16bit 4:2:0, mode=1</li>
        <li>Fix: MDegrain, out16=true: Green bottom lines when overlap blocks are not covering the full vertical area</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.30 (20180405)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: crash in MFlowInter (and possibly other MFlow...) v2.7.29 revelead this additional bug (which was not even 100% reproducible), this fix is basically the 2nd part of the solution.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.29 (20180403)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: MFlowInter (and possibly other MFlow...) crash with specific combination of analyze parameters (e.g. blkSize=16,overlapv=4,divide=1). Bug existed since at least 2.5.11.22</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.28 (20180323)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: in MDegrain1-6/N allow Y8 input for out16 parameter</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.27 (20180318)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: MDepan: use zerow parameter. The parameter had no effect probably since it was introduced</li>
        <li>MDepan: report MT mode for Avisynth+. MT_MULTI_INSTANCE, except for logfile writing output mode (MT_SERIALIZED)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.26 (20180314)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MDegrain1-6 and N: new parameter bool "out16" = false. If set, 8 bit input results in native 16bit output (like lsb=true hack but this is native). Faster than lsb=true by up to 12% (i7-7700)</li>
        <li>Faster: special 10 bit SAD functions instead of the generic 10-16bit one. Depending on the block size, 4-17% gain for a typical MDegrain1-6 session</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.25 (20180227)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: x64: not-cleared mmx state in MSuper assembly code would cause crash later, e.g. in x264 encoding, depending on following filters.</li>
        <li>Fix: MSCDetection SC value parameter name to Ysc from Yth (must be an ancient typo), docs are OK, but the fix is mentioned in docs</li>
        <li>
            MSuper: import 8 bit sse2 interpolators from mvtools-vs. Extend them for 10-16bits (faster super clip). Some filters are still todo.
        </li>

            <li>
                Some bug fixes (memory leaks), code consolidation (rewriting) for stability and performance improvements.
                Also there is a multitude of changes due to the addition of threading class,
                semaphore class, critical section class, thread files for MVDegrain, MVAnalyseMulti
                as well as factoring out common code for MVDegrain into a single base class moving out common code etc.
                There are no changes of algorithms.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>MVCompensate</code> changed : a new parameter, idx, which works as idx in <code>MVAnalyse</code>,
                and which allows speed up when compensating the same frames several times.

        </ul>
        <p>0.9.8</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Yet another little changes in the filters' syntax. The core changed a lot,
                in order to gain speed were it was possible. However, by default, the speed gain won't be
                visible, you'll need to configure correctly the analysis filter through its "idx"
                parameter in order to gain speed ( in the mode "pel" = 2 ).
            </li>
            <li>Bugfixes in MVDenoise, and chroma denoising in MVDenoise.</li>
            <li>
                Now, the filters down the filter's chain tell to the analysis filter if they need
                the compensation, so you don't have to worry about that at the analysis stage.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>0.9.7</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Yet again, a lot of rewriting. Interpolating filters are disabled ( for the moment ),
                all the other filters work and should be considered as stable. Syntax has changed a lot,
                and will change again before reaching 1.0 ( if it's reached one day ). Changes mainly affect
                <code>MVAnalyse</code>. New filter :  <code>MVChangeCompensate</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>0.9.6.2</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Fixed bug in <code>MVMask</code> parameters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>0.9.6.1</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lot of bugfixes for the existing filters. MVMask, MVShow, MVCompensate, MVDenoise and MVSCDetection, and MVAnalyse should work .
                Other may crash unexpectedly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now, for the three new filters. Two have nothing to do with motion compensation,
                but I didn't want to put them in separate binaries, since they'll mainly be used with filters from this package.
                The third one uses vectors, and integrates somehow the two others.
            </li>
            <li>
                QDeQuant(clip c, int quant, int level) : takes a clip and quantizes it, using an approximation of the H264 DCT.
                It filters the three planes ( 4x4 blocks for each of them, so the chroma isn't processed as in H264 ).
                It's not exactly the H264 DCT because at q1, it's lossless, and a q51 it's not that bad, but you can raise quant over 51.
                Level is the reference level of the picture.
                By default it's zero, but it can be set, for example, to 128.
                The picture is then treates as if pixels were ranging from -128 to 127, hence avoiding errors around 128.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deblock(clip c, int quant, int aOffset, int bOffset ) : takes a clip, and deblock it using H264 deblocking,
                as if the picture was made only of inter blocks. This time, quant ranges from 0 to 51 as in H264, and has the same impact.
                aOffset and bOffset allow to raise / lower the quant when deciding for some internal thresholds.
                They are set by default to 0. Be warned that the filter should do nothing at quant lesser 16, if aOffset and bOffset are both zero.
                It's a wanted behavior ( thus it respect the partially the norm ).
            </li>
            <li>
                EncDenoise(clip c, clip vectors, bool scbehavior, int quant, int aOffset, int bOffset, int thSCD1, int thSCD2) :
                it merges Deblock, QDeQuant and MVCompensate, taking from them the name and behavior of their parameters.
                It basically does a h264 encode as if all blocks were 8x8 inter blocks.
                Reference frame is the previous frame output by the filter ( if it is the correct one, else it's the previous frame of the source ),
                mvs are those given by mvanalyse on the source. The reference frame is compensated by the vectors,
                then the residual difference is quantized / dequantized and added to the result of the motion compensation.
                Finally, the frame is deblocked, and serves as reference for the next one.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>0.9.5.3</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mainly a bugfixe ( several filters were affected by a silly bug , and MVCompensate now do padded motion compensation,
                and compensate also the chroma ( though it rounds the vector to odd coordinates to do so )
            </li>
            <li>
                A new feature, as asked by Fizick, for mvcompensate :
                "scbehavior", a boolean set to true by default, will allow you to keep the previous frame over a scenechange if you set it to false.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>0.9.5.2</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                MVMask has two new parameters : showsad (bool) which allows to build the mask of the SAD values instead of the mask of the vectors' length.
                Ysc allows you to set the value taken by the mask on scene changes
            </li>
            <li>MVCompensate : behavior modification on scene changes. Now, the current frame is left untouched if a scene change was detected.</li>
            <li>New filter : MVSCDetection, with one parameter, Ysc, which works as previouslymscdetection.</li>
            <li>MVInterpolate, MVConvertFPS and MVBlur are enabled, but may be buggy ( though I wasn't able to make MVConvertFPS crash )</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            0.9.5
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Huge rewritting of the core engine. Vectors are now searched with a
                precision up to the pixel ( because no other filters can use yet more
                precise vectors, except MVShow ). The search engine is now fast ( which
                doesn't mean necessarily that the filters which use it are fast )
            </li>
            <li>
                A new parameter for MVAnalyse : lambda. See the documentation of the
                filter to see how it works
            </li>
            <li>MVDenoise works better.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            0.9.4
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Vectors can be saved to a file. In order to do so, add the parameter
                filename="C:\foo.bar" to the filter MVAnalyse. If the file doesn't exist,
                vectors will be saved into it. If it exists, vectors will be read from it. But,
                be warned :
                <ul>
                    <li>The file for a whole movie will be around 500 MB</li>
                    <li>
                        Saving / reading from a file need for the moment a linear access to
                        the frames, so it has to be used only when encoding the movie, not when doing
                        random access in it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The speed gain is not as great as one may hope, because SADs can't be
                        saved ( it would take too much space ) and so have to be recomputed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The filter MVDenoise now works on 5 frames, and its parameters are now
                "thT" and "sadT" ( have a look in the documentation to see how they work ). It
                works nice ( very good for heavy denoising )
            </li>
            <li>
                The scene change detection thresholds have slightly changed. Now, a block
                has changed if its SAD it over thSCD1. The default for thSCD1 is 300, and for
                thSCD2 it is 130. It orks well ( better than the previous SCD engine ).<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>0.9.3</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Last cleanings in the search of the motion vectors. It should be slightly
                faster
            </li>
            <li>
                More search parameters can be set by the user, especially the search
                algorithm. See the documentation
            </li>
            <li>
                Server / client implemented. You now first have to use MVAnalyse, and
                then the filter you want. Look at the documentation and at the examples I'll
                give alter.
            </li>
            <li>
                MVCompensate is separated from MVShow ( it's more logic that way ). For
                the moment, it doesn't move the chroma ( same behavior as MVShow in the latest
                releases )
            </li>
            <li>
                Some cleaning in MVBlur / MVInterpolate / MVConvertFPS, but still some
                work to do. Now, MVBlur blurs around the frame, not between the frame and the
                previous one.
            </li>
            <li>
                Half of the work is done for writing vectors to a file. But the resulting
                file will be large ( around 500 MB - 1 GB I guess ).
            </li>
            <li>MVDenoise is slightly faster ( at least it should )</li>
            <li>
                Copies are optimized inside the filter, thanks to avisynth's copy
                functions.
            </li>
            <li>
                MVShow can display the mean SAD of the compensation ( using showsad =
