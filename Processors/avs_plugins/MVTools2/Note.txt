This package contains DLLs built with different C++ compilers.

MSVC (Visual C++) builds require only Intel SSE2 (but of course code is optimized up to AVX2).
Other builds (Intel, Clang) require SSE4.2 capable processor as a minimum.

Which one to choose?

When in doubt, use MSVC.
The others are provided for your convenience, test them and use the quickest one for your special use case and environment.
