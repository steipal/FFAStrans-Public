GENERAL INFO:


      Supports 8-16 bit Y, planar YUV (4:1:1, 4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:4:4) and YUY2 colorspaces.

      MergeHints transfers hints present in one clip into another.  It will work with
   any filter that uses the method of hiding hints in the least significant bit of the
   first 64 pixels in the Y plane of the image (decomb, dgdecode, tfm, etc...).

    NOTE:  this only allows the use of filters that do not alter the # of frames
           or the frame/field order inbetween the spots the hints are being tranferred
           from.  That means denoisers, color correction, and the like will work, but
           not selectevery(), convertfps(), etc...

        MergeHints(clip hintClip, bool debug)


   example script =>


        This is a script where TFM's hints would normally be destroyed and never reach
        TDecimate:

                   mpeg2source(d2v="source.d2v")
                   tfm(d2v="source.d2v")
                   temporalsoften(3,3,5,15,2)   #destroys the hints
                   blur(0.25)                   #destroys the hints
                   tdecimate(mode=1)


        To fix this, and preserve the hints (they can greatly aid decimation, especially
        if using hybrid detection), use MergeHints as follows:

                   mpeg2source(d2v="source.d2v")
                   tfm(d2v="source.d2v")
                   savedHints = last
                   temporalsoften(3,3,5,15,2)
                   blur(0.25)
                   MergeHints(hintClip=savedHints)
                   tdecimate(mode=1)



PARAMETERS:


     hintClip -

         The clip that contains the hints to be transferred.

         Default:  NULL  (PClip)


     debug -

         Will spit out some info using OutputDebugString().  You can use the utility
         "DebugView" from sysinternals to view this info.  The info is just the
         specifier (first 32 lsbs) and the hint (second 32 lsbs) that MergeHints finds
         in hintClip.

         Default:  false  (bool)



CHANGE LIST:
   v1.3 - (20200611 - pinterf)

      - 10-16 bit and greyscale support

   (same number) (20200508 - pinterf)
      - opt = 1 and opt = 2 is like opt = 3
      - add all planar YUV support (422, 444, 411) besides 420

   v1.2 - (10/22/2006)

      - append "0x" to the front of hex values in debug output
      - identify dgdecode/decomb when seeing (0xdeadbeef)... could be either one


   v1.1 - (3/23/2006)

      - replace frame copy with makewritable
