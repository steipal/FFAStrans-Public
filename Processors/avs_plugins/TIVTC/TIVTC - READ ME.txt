INFO:
   Based on TIVTC v1.0.5   HELP FILE - (08 January, 2008)


       TIVTC is actually a combination of 7 different filters and 3 conditional functions.
   The seven filters included are TFM, TDecimate, MergeHints, FrameDiff, FieldDiff,
   ShowCombedTIVTC, and RequestLinear.  TFM is a field matching filter that will recreate the
   original progressive frames in a telecined source, and TDecimate is a decimation filter that
   removes duplicates. These filters can be used together to achieve an ivtc or separately to
   accomplish other tasks.  TDecimate also provides special options for handling hybrid material
   which include vfr via matroska (using a timecodes file) and blend decimation/upconversion for
   cfr solutions.  Mergehints, RequestLinear, FrameDiff, FieldDiff, and ShowCombedTIVTC are
   special utility filters included to help perform specific functions. The conditional functions
   are IsCombedTIVTC, CFieldDiff, and CFrameDiff which can be used via Avisynth's conditional
   filtering environment to test if frames are combed, determine how well two fields fit together,
   or calculate the difference between frames.

       For more info about using each of the filters/functions consult the individual readme files.

  Beginning with 1.0.16 all filters were updated to support 
  - 8 bit YV411, YV16 and YV24 besides existing YV12 and YUY2

  Beginning with 1.0.19 all filters were updated to support additionally
  - 10-16 bits formats
  - Greyscale and planar YUV colorspaces (4:1:1, 4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:4:4)
    (YUY2 support was kept, note that planar YV16 and YUY2 is losslessly convertables into each other)

  Beginning with 1.0.27 frame property support was introduced
