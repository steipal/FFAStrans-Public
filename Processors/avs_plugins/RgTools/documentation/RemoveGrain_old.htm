		<P>The binary package contains&nbsp;four versions of RemoveGrain, two small 
			dynamically linked versions RemoveGrain.dll, RemoveGrainSSE2.dll, 
			RemoveGrainSSE3.dll&nbsp; and the big staticly linked 
			RemoveGrainS.dll.&nbsp;The first one only requires integer SSE (Athlon 
			and&nbsp;Pentium 3 design), the second requires a SSE2 capable cpu (Pentium 4 
			or Athlon 64) and the third is for Prescott P4s only. If none of these dlls 
			work because of a missing dll, one has either to copy the missing dll to the 
			window's system directory or one has to use RemoveGrainS.dll, which only 
			requires SSE. Please put only one of the three plugins into the Avisynth plugin 
			directory. RemoveGrain supports all color spaces. YV12 is directly supported 
			and YUY2, RGB24, RGB32 are supported in planar form (see the section Color 
			Spaces).&nbsp;Beginning with version 0.6 the auxiliary filter Clense has been 
			added to RemoveGrain.dll and the plugin Repair.dll has been added to the binary 
			package. There are again four versions of this 
			plugin.&nbsp;Though&nbsp;Repair.dll is derived from the same source code, it 
			serves for quite different purposes. This plugin contains the filters Repair 
			and TemporalRepair. All three new filters are described below. Please 
			post&nbsp;questions, problems, comments etc.&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<A href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=79751">RemoveGrain 
				thread</A> &nbsp;of the doom9 forum rather than sending me email.&nbsp;In 
			particular, I would appreciate reports about artifacts and compression gain of 
			the various modes. These may also help others to select the right mode.

		<H2><FONT size="6">How it works</FONT></H2>
		<P>RemoveGrain is a purely spatial denoiser for Avisynth.&nbsp;However, in 
			combination with Clense and the Repair plugin&nbsp;more powerful 
			spatio-temporal denoisers and Deinterlacers can be built as Avisynth functions 
			(see the examples below). Modes 1-10,17,18&nbsp;are for&nbsp;truely progressive 
			input only, while modes 13-16 are primarilarily for interlaced input and are 
			used for constructing deinterlacers.&nbsp;While&nbsp;modes 1-10,17,18&nbsp;can 
			be used for interlaced and telecined material as well by applying it to the 
			separated fields, the quality is inferior, because the&nbsp;adjacent pixels 
			have twice the vertical distance, which clearly has a negative impact on 
			quality. With&nbsp; RemoveGrain one can't remove big spots or scratches from a 
			clip. Rather it&nbsp;was designed &nbsp;for the very small&nbsp;spots - not 
			much larger than a pixel. Although the changes made by RemoveGrain are hardly 
			visable the impact on compression may be quite substantial. In modes 1-10,17,18 
			the value of the center pixel is replaced by the value of one of its eight 
			neighbours. This applies to the luma and the chroma liekwise. More precisley, 
			for a given pixel x RemoveGrain looks at the eight spatial neigbours of that 
			pixel and chooses two of these neighbours, say, a,b for <EM>minmax clipping</EM>, 
			i.e. x is replaced by min(max(x, min(a,b)), max(a,b)). The choice of a,b 
			depends strongly on the <EM>mode</EM> variable. If&nbsp;1 &lt;= mode &lt;= 4 a 
			minmax clipping is done&nbsp;at a(mode), a(9-mode), where a(1) &lt;= a(2) &lt;= 
			a(3) &lt;= a(4) &lt;= a(5) &lt;= a(6) &lt;= a(7) &lt;= a(8) is the sequence of 
			neighbours ordered by the luma.&nbsp;Thus, if&nbsp;the number of neighbours 
			with luma &gt;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;is greater than the value of the <EM>mode </EM>variable&nbsp;and 
			if the number of&nbsp; neighbours with luma &lt;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;is greater 
			than <EM>mode</EM>&nbsp;as well, then the luma of this pixel is left unchanged. 
			Clearly this method only makes sense for 1 &lt;= mode &lt;= 4. If mode=1, then 
			RemoveGrain(mode=1) is identical with trbarry's <A href="http://www.trbarry.com" target="_blank">
				Undot</A> &nbsp;(even the speed of the SSE version is nearly identical to 
			that of Undot, but the SSE2 and especially the SSE3 versions&nbsp;are 
			significantly faster).&nbsp;The chroma values are treated similarily, 
			but&nbsp;instead of the <EM>mode</EM> variable, the variable <EM>modeU</EM> is 
			used for the U plane and <EM>modeV</EM> is used for the V plane. However, the 
			value of the <EM>mode </EM>variable is the default value for the <EM>modeU</EM> 
			variable and the value of the <EM>modeU</EM> variable is the default value for 
			the <EM>modeV</EM> variable. Let us look at an example:&nbsp;assume that the 
			pixel has the luma value 32 and that the eight neighbours have the luma values 
			21, 122, 77, 25, 56, 200, 133, 45. If <EM>mode </EM>&lt;= 2, then the pixel 
			remains unchanged, because there&nbsp;are two&nbsp;neighbours with smaller 
			luma&nbsp;and six with larger luma. If <EM>mode</EM>=3, then the luma of the 
			pixel is increased to 45. Finally, if <EM>mode</EM>=4, then the luma&nbsp;is 
			increased&nbsp;to 56. With <EM>mode</EM>=1,2 the filter is fairly artifact 
			free. Thin lines are preserved by these modes including the two end points. If<EM> mode</EM>=3 
			or 4, then thin lines may be destroyed by RemoveGrain.&nbsp;Thus RemoveGrain(<EM>mode</EM>=3 
			or <EM>mode</EM>=4) may only be used with some caution. The fairly risk free <EM>mode</EM>=2 
			is the default value. It still&nbsp;does significantly more denoising than 
			Undot, i.e.&nbsp;<EM>mode</EM>= 1. The larger the value of mode (between 1 and 
			4 only), the softer the look of the output and the higher the compression 
			ratio. The smart mode 17, introduced in version 0.8, is of special importance. 
			It&nbsp;is a variant&nbsp;of modes 4.&nbsp;However, unlike mode 4, 
			it&nbsp;preserves thin lines, although the pixels at the two ends of a thin 
			line may get lost. Whenever mode= 4 doesn't destroy thin lines through a pixel, 
			then mode 17 handles a&nbsp;pixel&nbsp;just like&nbsp;mode 4, otherwise&nbsp;a 
			mode&nbsp;slightly more aggressive than&nbsp;mode&nbsp;2 is used. Unlike the 
			modes &lt;= 4 the modes between 5-9,17,18 are <EM>edge sensitive</EM> . While 
			in mode &lt;= 4 any pair of neighbours is a possible choice for minmax 
			clipping, in modes 5-9,18 only line pairs are used. There are four such pairs: 
			firstly the horizontal pair consisting of the left and the right neighbour of 
			the pixel, secondly the vertical pair consisting of the top and bottom 
			neighbour, thirdly the diagonal pair consisting of the bottom left and the top 
			right neighbour and finally the diagonal pair consisting of top left and the 
			bottom right neighbour.&nbsp; If <EM>mode</EM>=9, then we choose simply that 
			line pair (a,b) for minmax clipping, for which&nbsp;|a - b|&nbsp;is minimal (as 
			usual |y| = max(y,-y)&nbsp;denotes the absolute value of a number y)&nbsp;. 
			Thus RemoveGrain(mode= 9) is just a purely spatial variant of trbarry's <A href="http://www.trbarry.com" target="_blank">
				ST Median</A> filter. If <EM>mode</EM>=5, then that line pair (a,b) is 
			chosen for minmax clipping, for which |x - y| is minimal (here x is the 
			original luma value of the pixel and y=min(max(x, min(a,b)), max(a,b)) is the 
			value obtained by minmax clipping). The modes 6,7,8 are intermediate modes 
			between <EM>mode</EM>=5 and <EM>mode</EM>=9. <EM>mode</EM>=6 is closer to <EM>mode</EM>=5 
			while&nbsp;<EM>mode</EM>=8 is closer to <EM>mode</EM>=9 and <EM>mode</EM>=7 is 
			right in the middle between <EM>mode</EM>=5 and <EM>mode</EM> =9.&nbsp; Mode 5 
			preserves thin lines including the two end points. Mode 6-8&nbsp;also preserve 
			thin lines, but end points may get lost (the likelyhood of such a loss 
			increases&nbsp;with the mode number). Fizick has extended mode 5-9 to the 
			temporal domain in his plugin <A href="http://bag.hotmail.ru">DeGrainMedian</A>. 
			Because there are now 26 instead of 8 neighbour pixels, these extension are 
			necessarily slower. Nevertheless the temporal extension makes a lot of 
			sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mode 18 (added in version 0.9) has&nbsp;preserves thin 
			lines&nbsp;often also with the two end&nbsp;points, but it should be clearly 
			inferior to mode 17 as far as compression is concerned. &nbsp;
		</P>
		<P>Beginning with version 0.6 we have also&nbsp;added a fast implementation 
			of&nbsp;the most important 3x3 convolution as mode 11. If y(i,j) denotes the 
			luma of the pixel with coordinates i,j, then mode 11 replaces y(i,j) by 
			(4*c(i,j) + 2*(c(i-1,j) + c(i+1,j) + c(i,j-1) + c(i,j+1)) + (c(i-1,j-1) + 
			c(i-1,j+1) + c(i+1,j-1) + c(i+1,j+1)) + 8)/16 (+8 is necessary for proper 
			rounding). Thus the all pixels are blurred vertically and horizontally with a 
			(1/4,1/2,1/4) kernel. The builtin Blur(1) claims to do the same, but it really 
			doesn't. Mode 12 (added in version 0.7) is a significantly faster version of 
			mode 11, which is slightly less precise (the difference between both is always 
			&lt;=1). Thus, unless you are pedantic, you should always use mode 12 instead 
			of 11. In version 0.7 the two bob modes 13 and 14 have been added. Mode 13 
			leaves the bottom field unchanged and interpolates the top field. Mode 14 
			leaves the top field unchanged and interpolates the bottom field. The 
			interpolation in mode 13, 14 is similar to Trbarry's weird bob, which is part 
			of Trbarry's <A href="http://www.trbarry.com" target="_blank">Tomsmocomp</A>. 
			However, instead of optimising over 5 line pairs we optimise only over&nbsp;3 
			line pairs. More precisely,&nbsp;c(i,j) is replaced either by (c(i-1,j-1) + 
			c(i&nbsp;+1,j+1)+1)/2 or (c(i-1,j+1) + c(i&nbsp;+1,j-1)+1)/2 or (c(i,j-1) + 
			c(i,j+1)+1)/2, depending on which of the&nbsp;three distances 
			|c(i-1,j-1)&nbsp;- c(i&nbsp;+1,j+1)|, &nbsp;|c(i-1,j+1)&nbsp;- 
			c(i&nbsp;+1,j-1)|, &nbsp;|c(i,j-1) - c(i,j+1)| is minimal. In Trbarry's weird 
			bob (c(i-2,j-2) + c(i&nbsp;+2,j+2)+1)/2&nbsp;and (c(i-2,j+2) + 
			c(i&nbsp;+2,j-2)+1)/2 are possible interpolation values as well. Thus weird bob 
			is more edge sensitve, but also the likelihood of smart edge artifacts is 
			higher and of course it is slower. Taking only 3 line pairs seems to be the 
			best compromise to us. Together with the filter TemporalRepair, described 
			below, it may be used for builting motion adaptive&nbsp;deinterlacers. 
			Beginning with version 0.8 we have added modes 15, 16. They have the same edge 
			sensitivity as modes 13,14 but the quality is somewhat higher and the speed 
			somewhat lower.</P>
		<P>
			Which mode is the best for denoising? As far as compression is concerned, my 
			benchmarks so far give the following mode ranking: 4,17,9,8,3,7,6,2,5,1, but 
			modes 4 and 17 really stand out.&nbsp;As far as artifacts are concerned, we 
			have unfortunately almost the reverse mode ranking: 1,5,2,18,6,7,8,17,3,4,9. 
			Modes= 1,5,2 are the risk free modes, the modes 18,6,7,8,17 show low to 
			moderate artifact risk (usually some softness) and&nbsp;modes 3,4,9 have severe 
			problems with thin lines. Mode 9 has less artifacts than mode 4, but when they 
			occur&nbsp; they look&nbsp;a lot more&nbsp;ugly. Mode&nbsp;17&nbsp;is my clear 
			personal favorite. As far as compression is concerned&nbsp;it is&nbsp;fairly 
			close&nbsp;to the leader, mode 4, and&nbsp;I have only seen some 
			softness&nbsp;but hardly&nbsp;any visable&nbsp;artifacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The frame 
			width of the input clip must be&nbsp;&gt; 36 (SSE version) or &gt; 68 (SSE2 
			version).
		</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">Optimal Usage</FONT></H2>
		<P>1. As already mentioned, RemoveGrain cannot change border pixels. To get rid of 
			these, cropping should be done <EM>after</EM> RemoveGrain. On the other hand, 
			for RemoveDirt cropping should be done before such that&nbsp;DCT blocks and 
			RemoveDirt blocks are the same. Thus, if RemoveGrain is combined with 
			RemoveDirt cropping should be done at best between RemoveGrain and Removedirt.
		</P>
		<P>2. Although&nbsp;RemoveGrain always makes a lot of unaligned memory 
			access&nbsp;aligning frames&nbsp;nevertheless has a positive performance 
			impact. Thus crop with <EM>align</EM>=true, if you need to crop before 
			RemoveGrain.
		</P>
		<P>3. If mode=0 (resp. modeU=0, resp. modeV=0), then the Y plane (resp. the U 
			plane, resp. the V plane) is simply copied from input to output. If even mode 
			&lt; 0 (resp. modeU &lt; 0, resp. modeV &lt; 0) then for the respective planes 
			nothing is done at all (not even a copy operation).&nbsp;This may be used for 
			faster processing of black&amp;white clips. For instance RemoveGrain(mode=8, 
			modeU= -1).RemoveDirt(grey= true) is the fasted way to process a 
			black&amp;white clip by the RemoveGrain/RemoveDirt combo. Because modeV 
			inherits the value -1 from modeU, RemoveGrain doesn't process the chroma planes 
			and RemoveDirt subsequently sets the chroma planes uniformly to 128. If you use 
			modeU=-1, you must add a chroma later through the builtin filters MergeChroma 
			or GreyScale.
		</P>
		<P>4. RemoveGrain is fairly fast. It makes perfect sense to iterate it for better 
			denoising. For instance, RemoveGrain(mode=2). RemoveGrain(mode=2) is still a 
			fairly defensive denoiser, which doesn't destroy thin lines.
		</P>
		<P>5. If grain is too crude, RemoveGrain can only partially remove it or cannot 
			remove it at all. Because in such a case the source is quite poor anyway, it is 
			a good idea to shrink. Then also the grain gets smaller and RemoveGrain may be 
			able to erase it. In general, downsizing should be done <EM>before </EM>RemoveGrain 
			while upsizing should be done <EM>after</EM> RemoveGrain.</P>
		<P>6. As described above, some modes, especially mode 3,4,9, have a thin line 
			problem. Now YUY2 and especially YV12 have a buitlin thin line problem for the 
			chroma, because several pixels share one chroma value. This problem is 
			amplified if RemoveGrain is applied to the chroma.&nbsp;It should be kept in 
			mind, that RemoveGrain has roughly four times the strength, if it is applied to 
			the YV12 chroma rather than the luma. This is the main reason for edge softness 
			caused by the more conservative modes 18,6,7,8,17. Thus to avoid compounding 
			the thin line problem, it is a good idea to use modes without a thin line 
			problem for the chroma even if mode 3,4,9 is used for the luma. For instance 
			RemoveGrain(mode=4, modeU=2) uses the high compression mode 4 for the luma and 
			the low artifact mode 2 for the chroma. On the other hand the chroma is often 
			particularily noisy (especially if the clip originates from a video tape), 
			which speaks against applying a more conservative mode for the chroma.
		</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">Clense</FONT></H2>
		<P>Clense uses the same simple cleaning technique as <A href="http://www.RemoveDirt.de.tf">
				RemoveDirt</A></B>, but without any protection against artifacts. 
			Thus,&nbsp;if p[i,j],c[i,j],s[i,j] denotes the luma of the pixel with 
			coordinates i,j on the previous, the current and the subsequent frame, then 
			c[i,j] is replaced by min(max(c[i,j], min(p[i,j],s[i,j])), 
			max(p[i,j],s[i,j]))), i.e. temporal minmax clipping. Clense is a very brutal 
			cleaner and cannot be used without Repair or some other artifact remover. 
			Nevertheless if dirt or grain overlaps with similar dirt or grain on&nbsp;only 
			one&nbsp;adjacent frame, this overlap cannot be cleaned. This remark is 
			particularily important for grain (even invisable grain may have a very 
			significant negative impact on compression). Thus it&nbsp;enhances compression 
			quite a bit to remove this left over. The left over of Clense is usually 
			significantly smaller than the original grain, whence Clense + RemoveGrain is 
			considerably more effective and is able to remove much cruder grain&nbsp;than 
			RemoveGrain alone, but of course there is&nbsp;a severe&nbsp;artifact problem.</P>
		<P>Clense accepts two arguments. The first is the input clip and the second is the 
			boolean variable <EM>grey</EM> (<EM>grey</EM>=false is the default). If 
			grey=true, then there is no chroma processing at all, i.e. the chroma planes 
			contain random values and the greyscale filter has to be applied at some later 
			stage. The grey variable is ignored for clips with color spaces other than 
			YV12.</P>
		<P>Beginning with version 0.9 there are also the filters <STRONG>BackwardClense </STRONG>
			and <STRONG>ForwardClense</STRONG>. They are primarily for clensing at sharp 
			scene changes in the RemoveDirt script function. ForwardClense is for the first 
			frame of a new scene and BackwardClense is for the last frame of a scene. The 
			usage is the same as Clense.
		</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">Repair</FONT></H2>
		<P>
			Beginning with version 0.6 we have added the Repair plugin. It is generated 
			from the same source code as RemoveGrain, but serves a very different purpose. 
			Instead of removing grain, Repair should remove artifacts introduced by 
			previous filters. It does so by comparing the video before these filters were 
			applied with the video after application of these filters. Thus Repair requires 
			two clips as input. The first clip is the filtered and the second the 
			unfiltered clip. Otherwise Repair uses the same variables as RemoveGrain, but 
			modes 11-17, which do not make sense for Repair are disabled. Thus there are 
			currently 10 Repair modes.
		</P>
		<P>Repair works very similar as RemoveGrain, but unlike RemoveGrain, where the 
			center pixel and the neighbour pixels are both from the same frame of the clip, 
			in Repair the center pixel (i.e. the pixel to be changed) is taken from the 
			first clip (i.e. the filtered clip) and the neighbour pixels are taken from the 
			second clip (i.e. the&nbsp;unfiltered original&nbsp;clip). For instance 
			Repair(filtered, original, mode= 1)&nbsp;clips the luma of a pixel of the clip 
			"filtered", by the luma minimum and the luma maximum of the neighbour pixels of 
			the pixel in the clip "original". Thus Repair limits the amount of change from 
			clip "original" to the clip "filtered". This is clearly some kind of artifact 
			removal. The higher the mode (from 1 to 4 only) the stronger the artifact 
			removal. With <EM>mode</EM>=4, Repair(filtered, original, mode=4) 
			is&nbsp;fairly close&nbsp;to RemoveGrain(original, mode= 4, limit= 0). As 
			described above the center pixel of the original clip would be ignored. This 
			doesn't make sense. We have therefore made changes to include also the center 
			pixel of the original clip for all Repair modes. For instance, Repair(filtered, 
			original, mode=1) clips the center pixel of the filtered clip by the minimum of 
			all the 8 neighbours and the center pixel of the original clip on one side and 
			by the maximum of all the 8 neighbours and the center pixel of the original 
			clip on the other side. In particular, Repair(input, input, mode=1) doesn't 
			change at all&nbsp;the clip input. Without inlcluding the center pixel of the 
			original clip, Repair(input, input, mode= 1)&nbsp;would have been identical to 
			RemoveGrain(input, mode= 1) or Undot(input). In general, we have 
			RemoveGrain(input, mode=n) = Repair(input, input, n+1) for n=0,1,2,3.
		</P>
		<P>In version 0.9 we have added new Repair modes, which are derived from 
			RemoveGrain modes in a different way. To this end, let "f" be the luma value of 
			the center pixel of the filtered clip (which is to be repaired) and "o" be the 
			luma value of the same pixel in the original. Then as in the corresponding 
			RemoveGrain mode, two neighbour pixels with luma values, say, "n1", "n2" are 
			selected and&nbsp;"f" is clipped at min(n1,n2,o) and max(n1,n2,o). Of course, 
			the chroma is treated the same way. Such a Repair mode can be derived from any 
			RemoveGrain mode except modes 11-16. We have done this for mode 1-6, 17, 18 
			only. 11-18 are the corresponding repair modes. Thus Repair modes 11-16 
			correspond to the RemoveGrain modes 1-6, while Repair modes 17,18 correspond to 
			the RemoveGrain Modes 17,18. For mode 1 both methods for deriving Repair modes 
			coincide, whence Repair(mode=1) and Repair(mode=11) are identical. (Repair mode 
			16 is of particular importance. It restores thin lines and there is good chance 
			(but no guarantee) that even the end points are restored. It is currently the 
			primary Repair mode for the RemoveDirt script.
		</P>
		<P>Let us now discuss some examples for Repair. The first is a preliminary version 
			of <STRONG>RemoveDust</STRONG>:

			</TABLE>
		</P>
		<P>Firstly Clense brutally removes all temporal dirt but also introduces many 
			artifacts. Repair then removes these artifacts but also restores all bigger 
			pieces of dirt. While most of the motion artifacts from Clense are removed by 
			Repair, motion gets blurred quite a bit, but static areas are not touched. 
			Finally RemoveGrain (I recommend mode=8, 17&nbsp;or mode=4 for more 
			compression) removes the left over from Clense. Blurring motion has a much more 
			significant impact on compression than blurring static detail.&nbsp;On the 
			other hand, the human eye can not really concentrate on motion detail and may 
			even get "nervous" from motion details. Thus in my view&nbsp;RemoveDust is much 
			better&nbsp;than the usual "blur all a little" approach of most 
			denoisers.&nbsp; If you want a more a agressive Removedust, you may choose 
			repmode= 1 and/or apply RemoveGrainbefore Repair. Repair(mode= 9) is very 
			interesting. It restores all thin lines destroyed by clense. Nevertheless is 
			compression is&nbsp;remarkably good (the output size is usailly less than 
			5%-20% &nbsp;above that with Repair(mode= 2) or Repair(mode= 5) . I recommend 
			to use Repair only with modes 2, 5-9. Repair may also be used to tame 
			sharpeners:< /P> < P>

		<P>In the same way&nbsp;as Repair is derived from RemoveGrain, TemporalRepair is

		<P>mode=4 is definitely recommended for RemoveTemporalGrain. Of course compression 
			of RemoveTemporalGrain(4) output is worse than that of RemoveGrain(mode= 4) but 
			it is well above the more defensive RemoveGrain modes and fully preserves 
			static detail. For RemoveDust the situation is even better:

				</TR>
			</TABLE>
		<P></P>
		<P>Note that instead of the original clip "input", now the intermediate clip "rep" 
			is taken as the second clip. Compared with the previous version of RemoveDust 
			in the current&nbsp;(not yet the final) version&nbsp;RemoveGrain has just been 
			replaced by&nbsp;RemoveTemporalGrain and softness is reduced substantially if 
			mode=4. Static detail even remains untouched and compression doesn't suffer too 
			much. Though the edges of objects are even sharpened, if these objects are not 
			to tiny, RemoveDust looks somewhat soft and tiny moving objects may be whiped 
			out, a good part of the softness is only psychological, because virtually all 
			the natural flicker in a film, which doesn't contain any information, but to 
			which the human eye is quite used to, is removed. If such flicker is 
			reintroduced by a sharpener after decoding by a player (with ffdshow for 
			example), then RemoveDust clips should&nbsp;look quite crisp again.

		<P>TemporalRepair can also be used to build a reasonably fast, high compression, 
			threshold free, no motion no change deinterlacer:</P>

		</P>
		<P>&nbsp;While RemoveGrain(input, mode=12) deinterlaces every pixel, TemporalRepair 
			restores the static areas. This is rather typical for TemporalRepair, if a 
			filter messes up the static parts of a video these can be restored nicely - 
			without any threshold artifacts - by TemporalRepair. RGDeinterlace&nbsp;is a 
			blur deinterlacer, which&nbsp;behaves similar to&nbsp;AlignFields(mode=2) but 
			without any flicker, because there are no thresholds. If on one frame the 
			"motion&nbsp;value" of an area is slightly&nbsp;above the threshold and on the 
			next it is slightly below, then this&nbsp;area is deinterlaced on one frame and 
			unchanged on the other. This usually shows up as flicker, which is typical for 
			threshold based motion adaptive deinterlacers. It has quite negative effects on 
			compression.&nbsp;Unfortunately, in this form RGDeinterlace performs quite 
			badly in my ticker tape test, because TemporalRepair&nbsp;restores to much. 
			Though the artifacts in the ticker tape test are only visable with 400% 
			magnification in VirtualDub, they indicate that the deinterlacer is not 
			compression optimal, i.e. compression is wasted without gaining image quality. 
			To&nbsp;improve the performance in this test&nbsp;I have added the integer 
			variable <EM>smooth</EM> to TemporalRepair in version 0.7. If <EM>smooth</EM>=0, 
			the default value, then TemporalRepair performs as before. If smooth= 1 
			(currently only the values 0 and 1 are allowed), then TemporalRepair is no more 
			purely temporal, because it takes into account also the temporal fluctuation of 
			the 8 neighboring pixels.&nbsp;Consequently, TemporalRepair "repairs" less with <EM>
				smooth</EM>=1 than with <EM>smooth</EM>=0, but still the resulting 
			deinterlacer cannot pass the ticker tape test satisfactorily (though it is 
			better).&nbsp; Thus we have introduced smooth=2,3 in version 0.9 for this 
			purpose. Mode&nbsp;2 restores&nbsp;less than mode 0,1,3 and is therefore the 
			safest mode for deinterlacing and gives fairly good compression results. Mode 3 
			is also suitable for deinterlacing and should be chosen, if one aims to 
			preserve a maximum amount of detail. In the ticker tape test mode 2 performs 
			better than mode 3 and a lot better than mode 1, but it is still not artifact 
			free. However, it competes well with most other motion adaptive deinterlacers 
			(usually threshold based) in this test. One has to remove the remaining 
			artifacts by another application of RemoveGrain. In this way one gets the 
			following deinterlacer:

		<P>The above deinterlacers are all blur deinterlacers. To obtain sharp

			is a sharp version of the most primitive version of RGDeinterlace. It is 
			important to apply RemoveGrain with mode=12 after mode=14. If this is not done, 
			then the top field is preserved and the&nbsp;bottom field is interpolated, 
			which always results in&nbsp;rather poor compression, because the two fields 
			are too different (this can be nicely displayed with a sharpener).

		<P>Clense and TemporalRepair both have the optional <EM>grey</EM> variable. If <EM>grey</EM>= 
			true, then Clense and TemporalRepair leave the chroma completely 
			unprocessed.&nbsp;It is not even copied. Thus one has to use the builtin filter 
			Greyscale at some later stage to clean out the random values from the chroma. 
			This option is only valid for YV12 clips and is ignored for other color spaces. 
			The same effect can be achieved for the filters RemoveGrain and Repair if one

		<P>Until version 0.7 the above filters did also support the color spaces YUY2, 
			RGB24 and RGB32. It did so by converting these interleaved formats internally 
			into a planar ones, then the planar intemediate formats were processed as YV12 
			and finally the intermediate planar formats were converted back into the 
			original interleaved formats. If ,as in some of the above scripts, many 
			instances of the above filters are used, these conversion routines resulted in 
			enormous overhead. Also the conversion routines were not optimised. Beginning 
			with verison 0.8 we have dropped support for the interleaved color spaces in 
			favor of their planar analogs. For Avisynth planar YUY2, RGB24 or RGB32 frames 
			look just like the ordinary interleaved frames of these color spaces. However, 
			the organization of the data on these frames is very different. The not yet 
			released plugin SSETools (preliminary versions are included in the RemoveGrain 
			package) contains the basic filters Interleaved2Planar and Planar2Interleaved. 
			For YV12 these filters do absolutely nothing. For the other color spaces, 
			Interleaved2Planar converts the interleaved frames into frames with planar data 
			organisation and Planar2Interleaved reverses this conversion. Thus 
			Interleaved2Planar().Planar2Interleaved and 
			Planar2Interleaved.Interleaved2Planar(). leaves any frame unchanged. Thus 
			Planar2Interleaved and Interleaved2Planar are lossless filters. For YUY2 the 
			filters&nbsp;&nbsp;Interleaved2Planar() and Planar2Interleaved are highly 
			optimised and shouldn't cost much more than a simple bitblt. Now, in order to 
			prohibit unexperienced users from applying the above filters to interleaved 
			color spaces, we have added the boolean variable <EM>planar</EM> to 
			RemoveGrain, Repair and TemporalRepair. If <EM>planar</EM>=false (the default 
			value), then these filters reject YUY2, RGB24 and RGB32 frames. Only if <EM>planar</EM>=true, 
			then these filters accept YUY2, RGB24 and RGB32 input, but always assume that 
			the data are organised in a planar way. If you use <EM>planar</EM>=true with 
			ordinary interleaved input, you get garbage. Clense and MCClense like most 
			other purely temporal filters work the same way with planar and interleaved 
			input. Thus these filters have no<EM> planar</EM> variable and work both with 
			planar and interleaved input. TemporalRepair(smooth=0) is also purely temporal 
			and thus accepts YUY2, RGB24 and RGB32 input even with <EM>planar</EM>=false. 
			On the other hand,TemporalRepair(smooth=1) has also spatial aspects and 
			therefore rejects any YUY2, RGB24 and RGB32 input with <EM>planar</EM>=false. 
			In the not too distant future there should be a web site <A href="http://www.PlanarYUY2.de.tf">
				www.PlanarYUY2.de.tf</A> , which will list filters and there compatibility 
			with planar YUY2, RGB24, RGB32.
		</P>
		<P>As an example for the application of&nbsp; Planar2Interleaved and 
			Interleaved2Planar we give a version of RemoveDust, which works for YV12, and 
			all interleaved color spaces (but not planar YUY2, RGB24, RGB32):
