<h4>FFT3DFilter is 3D Frequency Domain filter - strong denoiser and moderate sharpener.</h4>

<h3>Technical info</h3>

<p>
FFT3DFilter uses Fast Fourier Transform method for image processing in frequency domain.
It is based on some advanced mathematical algorithmes of optimal filtration.
It works not locally, but makes some delocalized (block) processing.
In 3D mode, it results in effect similar to partial motion compensation.
This filter can reduce noise without visible quality loss and artefactes,
even with quite strong settings.
It can greatly improve compression and reduce encoded file size.<br>
Also it has option of limited sharpening without both noise amplifying and oversharpening (haloing).<br>
Fiction? Try it yourself! :)</p>

<h4>So, it is a spatial-temporal (3D) filter, and works as follows:</h4>

<ol>

<li>get current and some previous frames;</li>
<li>divide every frame to small overlapped blocks;</li>
<li>get frequency spectrum by windowed forward 2D FFT transform of every block
of these frames;</li>
<li>apply some filter to frequency spectrum;</li>
<li>optionally sharpen image (in 2D frequency domain) by amplifying of some frequencies; </li>
<li>make inverse 2D FFT transform of cleaned spectrum for every block;</li>
<li>do windowed summation of cleaned overlapped blocks to output frame.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overlapped blocks and weighting windows are used to prevent blockiness (and ringing).<br>
The blocks are overlapped by some value along their vertical and
horizontal sizes.<br>
The lesser overlap, the faster processing, but with more visible grid artifactes.</p>

<p>The overlapping definition is shown on picture.</p>

<p><img alt="overlap" src="overlap.gif"></p>

<p>Some analysis and synthesis weighting windows are used to get effective
signal gain=1 after blocks summation.</p>

<h4>Plugin has several processing modes at filter stage:</h4>

<ul>

<li> (Parameter <var>bt</var>=1)
2D (spatial) Wiener filter for spectrum data. Use current frame data only. Reduce
weak frequencies (with small power spectral density) by optimal Wiener
filter with some given noise value. Sharpening and denoising are
simultaneous in this mode.</li>
<li> (Parameter <var>bt</var>=2)
3D Wiener filter for spectrum data. Add third dimension to FFT by using
previous and current frame data. Reduce weak frequencies (with small
power spectral density) by optimal Wiener filter with some given noise
value. </li>
<li> (Parameter <var>bt</var>=3)
Also 3D Wiener filter for spectrum data with
previous, current and next frame data.</li>
<li> (Parameter <var>bt</var>=4)
Also 3D Wiener filter for spectrum data with
two previous, current and next frame data. </li>
<li> (Parameter <var>bt</var>=5)
Also 3D Wiener filter for spectrum data with
two previous, current and two next frames data.</li>
<li>(Parameter <var>bt</var>=0)
Temporal Kalman filter for spectrum data. Use all previous frames data
to get estimation of cleaned current data with optimal recursive data
process algorithm. The filter starts work with small (=1) gain (degree of
noise reducing), and than gradually (in frames sequence) increases the
gain if inter-frame local spectrum (noise) variation is small.
So, Kalman filter can provide stronger noise reduction than Wiener filter.
The Kalman filter gain is limited by some given noise value.
The local gain (and filter work) is reset to 1
when local variation exceeds the given threshold
(due to motion, scene change, etc). So, the Kalman filter output is history-dependent
(on frame taken as a start filtered frame).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Using noise pattern</h4>
<p>Since v1.5 it is possible to get noise pattern (shape)
by spectrum analysis of some empty block (without any objects),
and then to reduce the noise with the same pattern in whole frame and in whole clip.
It may be useful for removal of film (especially amateur 8 mm) grain and analog TV capture interference.<p>

<h4>Sharpening</h4>
<p> At sharpening stage (after denoising) the plugin amplifies high spectrum (spatial, 2D) frequencies .<br>
There is also sharpen-only mode without denoising (<var>bt</var>=-1).<br>
Since version 1.1, some special limited sharpening method is used :</p>
<ul>
<li>the weakest frequencies (with small amplitudes) are not amplified
to prevent noise increasing;</li>
<li>the strongest frequencies (with large amplitudes) are not amplified
to prevent oversharping and haloing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sharpening strength is maximal for frequencies with middle-range amplitudes.
Of course, you can control both these margins and general sharpening strength.</p>
<p>Since v.1.7, Gaussian High Pass Filter with variable cutoff frequency is used for sharpening.</p>
<p>Since v.1.9, plugin has special option <var>dehalo</var> for decreasing of strong frequencies,
it may be used for spatial adaptive softening of oversharped pictures (halo removal).
This mode may be combined with denoising and sharpening.</p>

</p>

<p>The most important parameter is a given noise value <var>sigma</var>.
You must use reasonable value based on a priori info for current clip.<br>
Typical value for digital sources is about 1.5 to 2.5, and about 3 and above for analog captured video.<br>
The good value of overlapping size is about quarter to half of block size.
The half (ow=bw/2, oh=bh/2) is the best, but slower.<br>
Good values of block size are about 32 to 64.</p>
<p>Filter can produce some grid artifacts for large <var>sigma</var>
 and small <var>bw, bh, ow, oh</var> or small relative overlap sizes, especially with sharpening enabled.<br>
Filter can produce ghosting for large <var>sigma</var> (and <var>kratio</var>) for 3D modes.</p>
<p>Weighting window <var>wintype</var>=0 can produce the worst grid artifactes,
window type <var>wintype</var>=2 do not produce grid artifactes, but can produce some ringing,
<var>wintype</var>=1 is intermediate case.</p>
<p>I recommend to use the weighting window compensation with <var>degrid</var>=1 (since version 1.8),
it improves the denoise quality and decreases the grid artifactes, especially for 2D.</p>
<p>Sharpening will result in worse clip compression.</>
</p>
<p>In order to use noise pattern method in place of ordinary (blind) method you must: <br>
Firstly switch show mode <var>pshow</var>=true, and set some non-zero value <var>pfactor</var>=1.0. <br>
Then select  frame number and some block position,
thus the block shown must not contain any objects beside typical noise pattern.<br>
The switch off show mode <var>pshow</var>=false, <br>
and set noise reduction strength, recomended value <var>pfactor</var>= 0.5 to 1.0.<br>
The best windows type for this method is <var>wintype</var>=2.<br>
The <var>sigma</var> and <var>beta</var> parameters are not used in this denoising method,
but you can use this method in show mode <var>pshow</var>=true
to estimate <var>sigma</var> value for ordinary denoising method
(it is not strictly the same, but similar value).</p>

<p>There is also composite method, when you can directly set different noise values
 <var>sigma</var> for highest and <var>sigma2, sigma3, sigma4</var> for lower frequencies.
 The pattern coefficients will be created internally from these sigmas values by interpolation.
 Set pfactor=0 for this method (internally it will be  =1).</p>

<h3>Features and limitations</h3>

<ol>

<li>Filter works only in YV12 or YUY2 color format.</li>
<li>Only specified single color plane may be processed (Y, U or V).
Since v1.8.4 it is possible to process several (all) color planes.</li>
<li>Since v1.3 it works with both progressive and interlaced clips. </li>
<li>Tested with Avisynth v2.55, v2.56.</li>
<li>Filter uses fast external FFTW library version 3 (<a href="http://www.fftw.org">http://www.fftw.org</a>)<br>
as Windows binary DLL (compiled with gcc under MinGW by Alessio Massaro),
which support for threads and have AMD K7 (3dNow!) support in addition to SSE/SSE2.<br>
It may be downloaded from
<a href="ftp://ftp.fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw3win32mingw.zip">ftp://ftp.fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw3win32mingw.zip</a><br>
<font color="#ff0000">You MUST
put FFTW3.DLL file from this package (not fft3dfilter.dll) to some directory in path (for example, C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32).<br>
Filter will NOT work without it!</font></li>
<li>FFTW works most efficiently for arrays whose size (<var>bw, bh</var>)
can be factored into small primes 2, 3, 5, and 7 (and one 11, 13), and
otherwise it uses a slower general-purpose routine.</li>
<li>First versions were really slooow! But recent
versions are simple slow :-).<br>
 Algorithm is improved and assembler 3DNow! and SSE instruction are used for some modes</li>
<li>Algorithm is optimized by speed for forward sequential frames access only.</li>
<li>The sharpening method is experimental, however is quite good since v1.1 (and v1.7).</li>
<li>The noise pattern method is experimental too.</li>
<li><var>degrid</var> option is not implemented for Kalman filter.</li>
<li>For noisy video it is useful to use median prefilter (for example DeGrainMedian)
   before FFT3Dfilter.</li>
<li>Multithread mode ncpu>1 is almost not tested (I do not have core duo), try to use ncpu=2 if you have.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Simple sample scripts</h3>

<h4>To denoise progressive or fieldbased (separated) clip luma:</h4>
<pre>Avisource("input.avi")
loadplugin("c:\plugins\fft3dfilter.dll")
FFT3DFilter(sigma=3)</pre>
<p>Of course, you must replace "c:\plugins" by your plugins folder path (and set your video pathname too :).
You can skip LoadPlugin command if you put fft3dfilter.dll file to autoloading plugins folder
(C:\Program Files\Avisynth 2.5\plugins). </p>

<h4>To sharpen only:</h4>
<pre>Avisource("input.avi")
loadplugin("fft3dfilter.dll")
FFT3DFilter(bt=-1, sharpen=0.7)</pre>

<h4>To denoise and slightly sharpen the interlaced clip:</h4>
<pre>Avisource("input.avi")
loadplugin("fft3dfilter.dll")
FFT3DFilter(sigma=2, sharpen=0.3, interlaced=true)</pre>

<h4>Some "best settings", slower processing</h4>
<pre>Avisource("input.avi")
loadplugin("fft3dfilter.dll")
fft3dfilter(sigma=1.5, bt=5, bw=32, bh=32, ow=16, oh=16, sharpen=0.4)
</pre>

<h4>To denoise all color planes (both luma and chroma)</h4>
<p>Note: The processing speed will be decreased more,
so you can consider other (simpler and faster) filters using for chroma denosing
(<code>CNR2</code>, <code>DeGrainMedian</code>, etc).</p>

<h4>To denoise all color planes with same settings</h4>
<pre>Avisource("input.avi")
loadplugin("fft3dfilter.dll")
fft3dfilter(sigma=2, plane=4)
</pre>

<h4>To denoise luma and chroma with different settings</h4>
<pre>Avisource("input.avi")
loadplugin("fft3dfilter.dll")
fft3dfilter(sigma=1.5, plane=0)
fft3dfilter(sigma=3, plane=3)
</pre>

<h4>Other way to denoise all color planes (script by AI)</h4>
<p>It was important in old versioms if you use motion compensation</p>
<pre>Avisource("input.avi")
loadplugin("fft3dfilter.dll")
YToUV(fft3dfilter(sigma=3, plane=1).UToY,\
fft3dfilter(sigma=3, plane=2).VToY,\
fft3dfilter(sigma=2, plane=0))
</pre>

<h4>To decrease the existing horizontal halo only</h4>
<pre>Avisource("input.avi")
loadplugin("fft3dfilter.dll")
fft3dfilter(bt=-1, plane=0, dehalo=1.0, hr=2.0, ht=50, svr=0)
</pre>

<li>Version 2.1.0 - January 17, 2007 - removed (temporary ?) experimental internal motion compensation mode.
</li>
<li>Version 2.1.1 - February 20, 2007 - fixed bug with bw not mod 4 (restored v1.9.2 method,
 thanks to JKinG for report).
</li>
<li>Version 2.2   - February 25, 2015 - martin53: made AviSynth 2.6 ready, FFT3dFilter2_VersionNumber function, error msgs
</li>
</li>
<li>Version 2.3   - February 21, 2017<br>
- apply current avs+ headers<br>
- 10-16 bits and 32 bit float colorspace support in AVS+<br>
- Planar RGB support<br>
- look for libfftw3f-3.dll first, then fftw3.dll<br>
- inline asm ignored on x64 builds<br>
- pre-check: if plane to process for greyscale is U and/or V then returns original clip<br>
- auto register MT mode for avs+: MT_SERIALIZED<br>
- autoscale sigma and smin/smax parameter from 8 bit scale if colorspace is different
</li>
<li>Version 2.4   - June 08, 2017<br>
- some inline asm (not all) ported to simd intrisics, helps speedup x64 mode, but some of them faster also on x86.<br>
- intrinsics bt=0<br> 
- intrinsics bt=2, degrid=0, pfactor=0<br>
- intrinsics bt=3 sharpen=0/1 dehalo=0/1<br>
- intrinsics bt=3<br>
- Adaptive MT settings for Avisynth+: MT_SERIALIZED for bt==0 (temporal), MT_MULTI_INSTANCE for others<br>
- Copy Alpha plane if exists<br>
- reentrancy checks against bad multithreading usage<br>
  Note: for properly operating in MT_SERIALIZED mode in Avisynth MT, please use Avs+ r2504 or better.
</li>
<li>Version 2.5   - July 02, 2018<br>
- Change 32 bit float formar: U/V chroma center to zero instead of 0.5 to match Avisynth+ r2728<br>
</li>
<li>Version 2.6   - January 31, 2019<br>
- Fix: Proper rounding before internal 32 bit float data are converted back to integer pixel values<br>
</li>
<li>Version 2.7   - November 30, 2020<br>
- Fix: make fftw plans thread safe.<br>
- preserve frame properties for avs+
</li>
<li>Version 2.8   - December 1, 2020<br>
- Fix: chroma plane filtering for 32 bit float formats
</li>
<li>Version 2.9   - March 24, 2021<br>
- Fix issue when pfactor <> 0 and using 10+ bits (Xinyue Lu, neo_FFT3D)<br>
- Fix incorrect negative value float to integer rounding (Xinyue Lu, neo_FFT3D r7)<br>
- add CMake build system<br>
- linux build<br>
- Replace never used 3dnow ApplyWiener3D4 with simd SSE2. (bt=4, degrid=0, pfactor=0) (2x speed)
</li>
<li>Version 2.10   - October 18, 2021<br>
- Fix possible crash on exit on ncpu=1 (uninitialized fft3w threads)<br>
- Fix C version (possibly unused on Intel builds, when CPU less than SSE2) in sharpen+degrid method
</li>
